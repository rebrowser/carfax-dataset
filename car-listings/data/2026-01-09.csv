This example is equipped with the factory 6.6L Twin-Turbocharged V12 that produces 563 horsepower and 575 lb-ft of torque, paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and rear-wheel drive. The powertrain is engineered to deliver effortless acceleration and long-distance cruising capability while remaining refined and composed at all speeds. Fuel economy is factory-rated at approximately 13 MPG city and 21 MPG highway, and this particular vehicle has well under 25,000 miles on the odometer — averaging less than 3,000 miles per year — reflecting light, predominantly highway use and careful ownership. Exterior and presence Finished in English White, the Ghost presents the restrained, formal elegance typical of the model line. The familiar Pantheon grille and Spirit of Ecstasy hood ornament are present in polished metal finish and remain focal points of the design. The sheetmetal is smooth and uncluttered with precise panel gaps and high-quality paint fitment. Standard exterior elements include adaptive xenon/HID headlamps with integrated LED daytime running lights, automatic headlamp operation, and rain-sensing wipers. Power-folding and heated exterior mirrors with integrated turn indicators are factory equipped, along with front and rear park sensors to aid low-speed maneuvering. The vehicle rides on factory alloy wheels with premium all-season tires sized to the original specification, and overall the exterior shows excellent condition consistent with the low mileage. Chassis, suspension and driving dynamics The Ghost’s chassis architecture is designed to isolate occupants from road irregularities while maintaining composure through corners. Factory equipment includes an adaptive air suspension system with automatic leveling and electronically controlled dampers, which adjust to driving conditions to balance ride comfort and body control. Electronic traction and stability control are standard, accompanied by ABS, a full complement of airbags (front, side and curtain), and advanced braking systems with ventilated discs. The transmission features adaptive shift logic to complement the twin-turbo V12’s broad torque curve, providing smooth, decisive downshifts and relaxed highway cruising. Interior appointments and comfort The cabin is trimmed in Moccasin full-grain leather applied throughout the seating surfaces, door panels and center console, with precise hand-stitched seams and attention to fit and finish. Wood veneer trim is integrated into the dash and door tops, selected and finished for grain consistency and tactile smoothness. Front seats are power-adjustable with multiple position memory for the driver, lumbar support and heating elements, they are shaped to provide support for long journeys while presenting a formal seating posture. Rear seating provides plentiful legroom and headroom, with a wide bench and a comfortable cushion — the Ghost’s rear accommodation is focused on passenger comfort and composure. Standard climate control is fully automatic and designed to maintain distinct comfort settings, rear climate controls are provided for passenger convenience. Additional factory comfort features include soft-close doors that close gently under power, power trunk operation, and a multifunction leather-wrapped steering wheel with controls for cruise control, audio and telephone functions. Technology and convenience Factory-fitted infotainment and convenience features include a central display and rotary controller for vehicle and audio systems, navigation system integrated with the vehicle’s electronics to assist in route planning and transmission shift strategy, Bluetooth hands-free phone and audio streaming capability, and a premium audio system with AM/FM, satellite radio capability and multiple input options (USB/AUX).

Our live market pricing mission is to present the best pricing to all of our customers. Pre-owned live market pricing is achieved by polling over 20,000 pre-owned web sites hourly. This ensures that every one of our customers receives real time market price on every pre-owned vehicle we sell. We do not artificially inflate our pre-owned prices in the hopes of winning a negotiating contest with our customers! We do not play pricing games. After being in business for 35&#43; years, we realize that live market pricing is, by far, the best approach for our customers.<br />BMW Courtesy Service Loaner vehicles--also known as courtesy cars--are dealer-owned models that stay on the dealership lot and are used exclusively for business purposes, including serving as temporary rentals for service-center clients whose personal vehicles will be in service for longer than they can afford to wait. What are the Benefits of Buying a BMW Courtesy Service Loaner or Demo Vehicle? • Competitive prices • Receive new car rates and special discounts • Higher standards of quality • Total confidence in your pre-owned BMW Our loaner vehicles live on-site when they&#39;re not serving clients. So, when they need an oil change, tire rotation, detailing, or minor work, our courtesy cars are treated by the expert technicians in our service center.

This is a Porsche––and the Taycan Turbo S is proof that performance and razor-sharp driving dynamics didn&#39;t die with the internal combustion engine––they just evolved. Dual electric motors deliver a staggering 750 horsepower and up to 774 lb-ft of torque when Launch Control is engaged, propelling the Taycan Turbo S from 0-60 mph in an astonishing 2.4 seconds. Porsche&#39;s advanced two-speed rear transmission and all-wheel-drive system ensure relentless acceleration, while offering around 200 miles of range on a full charge. And thanks to its low-slung battery, it doesn&#39;t just go fast in a straight line, it corners like a 911 on rails, with grip for days and instant torque vectoring. Step inside and you&#39;re greeted with a cockpit that blends Porsche tradition with next-gen tech. From the wraparound digital displays to the 18-way Adaptive Sport Seats, everything is focused, intentional, and driver-first. Some notable added options include heated/ventilated front seats, a Burmester sound system, and ceramic composite brakes.

More information about the 2014 Subaru Forester: The Subaru Forester has always been a very nice compromise between the practicality of a small hatchback or station wagon and the capabilities of an SUV. Though it can&#39;t off-road like some of the more serious SUVs out there, the Forester does at least come standard with all-wheel-drive, unlike most of its competition. Though base model Foresters perform similarly to competitors from Ford and Mazda, turbocharged versions offers significantly more power, resulting in sprightly performance. On-road handling is also a step above what is generally offered in this segment. The Forester starts at just under $22,000. Strengths of this model include All-wheel-drive, practical, good mix of fuel efficiency and performance, good ground clearance, improved interior space<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",173,

One of those is “relationship.” With every introduction, we are looking, not for a single transaction, but to “develop” a relationship with our customers...not just a good relationship, but an “outstanding” relationship that will outlast your car. Another key element is that “everybody wins”. In a time when most people believe winners create losers, we endeavor to satisfy everybody involved. It means knowing our product well and our customer even better. It means listening and caring and understanding that people buy their second-most expensive item from people they trust. Whether you are a car enthusiast, or you just need a reliable ride, the right car for you means buying exactly what you need and ideally what you want. Over forty years ago, we entered the automobile business driven by a passion for people, and recognizing cars as a “vehicle” for creating meaningful connections. We also understood that helping people select, purchase and finance one of the most important tools of your daily life is a valuable pursuit. Our priority is and has always been making sure your new or used-car buying experience is both satisfying and successful. Within the Cardinale Automotive Group, we know that satisfying a wide range of needs requires a diversity of quality cars. We offer new Audi, BMW, GMC, Harley Davidson, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan, Toyota and Volkswagen cars, along with used cars, trucks and SUVs by top manufacturers. We are committed to helping you find the right car, assisting you in choosing the right financing options, and becoming your trusted automobile dealer. Our relationship begins with our introduction and continues through the purchase, the financing, the service of the car and beyond. We look forward to developing an outstanding relationship with you.<br /><br /><br />18/26 City/Highway MPG AWD, 14-Way Power Seats, Ambient Lighting, BOSE Surround Sound System, Comfort Access, Front &amp; Rear Seat Heating, Front Seat Ventilation, Lane Change Assist (LCA), LED Headlights w/Porsche Dynamic Light System, Memory Package, Power moonroof, Premium Package Plus, Soft Close Doors, Sport Tailpipes in Black, Tinted LED Taillights w/Adaptive Brake Lights, Wheels: 21&#34; Exclusive Design in High-Gloss Black.<br /><br />2020 Porsche Panamera Chalk 4S<br /><br /><br />Plus government fees and taxes, any finance charges, any dealer document processing charge, any electronic filing charge, and any emission testing charge.

Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Audi smartphone interface w/wireless Apple CarPlay smart device wireless mirroring</li><li> Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.

Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety.

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Meet your ultimate co-pilot, GPS linked cruise control.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car.
