After all, statistics show that, after a home, an automobile is the biggest investment most of us will ever make. And, with most car dealers you are forced to enter a haggling/negotiating game to TRY to get the best deal possible. It&#39;s just too much!! But that is not the case at Quality Toyota. Our commitment to Bottom Line Pricing means that you get Our Best Price the first time, every time. You get our best price even before you talk to a sales person because Our Best Price is posted in the window of every vehicle on our lot. The No Hassle/No Haggle Way to Buy a Car, SUV, or Truck The fact that it is unnecessary to spend a great deal of time negotiating means that our salespeople can place emphasis where it belongs, finding the best possible vehicle for you, based on your needs and budget. After we find that vehicle (which will already have Our Best Price in the window), we only have to appraise your trade, if you have one, and arrange for an attractive financing plan for you.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead. * Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision. * Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control. * Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it.

Powered by Toyota’s proven Hybrid Synergy Drive system combining a 1.8L Hybrid I4 gasoline engine and electric motor for a combined output of 121 hp, this Corolla Hybrid delivers outstanding fuel efficiency and a refined driving experience. EPA-rated at 53 MPG city and 52 MPG highway, it provides significant savings at the pump without sacrificing everyday usability or comfort. Powertrain and Driving Characteristics At the heart of this Corolla Hybrid LE is the 1.8-liter hybrid four-cylinder paired with an advanced electric drive system. The powertrain is managed through an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (CVT), which contributes to smooth, linear acceleration and seamless transitions between electric and gasoline power. Regenerative braking recovers energy during deceleration to help recharge the hybrid battery, improving overall efficiency. The vehicle’s chassis tuning and suspension provide composed handling and a comfortable ride, ideal for urban commuting, highway cruising, and everything in between. Safety and Driver-Assist Features This Corolla LE comes factory-equipped with Toyota Safety Sense 2.0, a comprehensive suite of advanced driver-assistance technologies designed to enhance occupant protection and confidence behind the wheel. Key components include: - Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection to help identify and mitigate frontal impacts - Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control for more relaxed highway driving - Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist to help keep the vehicle centered - Automatic High Beams for improved nighttime visibility - Road Sign Assist to help recognize certain traffic signs and display them on the instrument cluster In addition to Safety Sense, the vehicle includes Toyota’s Star Safety System, which integrates Vehicle Stability Control, Traction Control, Anti-lock Brake System (ABS), Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Brake Assist, and Smart Stop Technology. Complementing these systems are multiple airbags, a tire pressure monitoring system, and a backup camera for added convenience when maneuvering. Exterior Details The exterior features a crisp White finish that highlights the Corolla’s clean, contemporary lines. Factory lighting includes bright, efficient headlamps and LED daytime running lights for improved visibility and a modern appearance. The streamlined profile is complemented by aerodynamic styling cues that aid fuel economy. Factory wheels present a tasteful blend of durability and style, and body-color exterior trim and heated power mirrors (standard on many Corolla trims) add practical convenience. Overall, the exterior is in excellent condition, reflecting careful ownership and routine care. Interior Comfort and Practicality Inside, the Tan cloth-trimmed cabin offers a welcoming, airy atmosphere with thoughtful ergonomics and premium textures. The driver-focused cockpit features intuitive controls, a multi-information display providing key hybrid data and trip information, and a comfortably contoured driver’s seat with manual adjustments to support extended journeys. Rear passengers benefit from generous legroom and headroom for a compact sedan, and the 60/40 split-folding rear seatback expands cargo flexibility when longer items need to be carried. The Corolla sedan provides a practical trunk with ample volume for groceries, luggage, or gear. Technology and Connectivity The factory-installed infotainment system provides modern connectivity and convenience. Standard features include an easy-to-navigate touchscreen interface with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration to mirror smartphone apps and enable hands-free communication and media control.

Low, low mileage coupled with an exacting maintenance program make this vehicle a rare find. The look is unmistakably Honda, the smooth contours and cutting-edge technology of this Honda Accord Sdn EX-L will definitely turn heads. You&#39;ve found the one you&#39;ve been looking for. Your dream car. More information about the 2010 Honda Accord Sdn: It&#39;s already been a couple of years since the Accord was completely redesigned, yet it&#39;s still a step ahead of most rivals in overall interior appointments. For those who want more of a performance feel, the Accord Sedan is one of few to offer a manual transmission with a V6 engine. All three of the engines are refined and powerful, while base LX and LX-P models look like a remarkable bargain for those who want a reasonably stylish sedan with low running costs. The Accord maintains an enviable reputation for longevity, reliability, and excellent resale value, which makes it hard to beat for those hoping to keep their car for many years. And for those interested in the coupe, it sacrifices a little bit of space and convenience but gets a rakish silhouette and most of the sedan&#39;s practicality. Strengths of this model include plush interior appointments on EX trims, Sporty driving feel, and stylish coupe styling<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",165.85,

We price our vehicles very competitively in the market to give you an extremely fair price right up front. We do not negotiate on the price of the vehicle. Most of our cars are priced at thousands below NADA retail value. We have taken many things into consideration when pricing the cars, exterior condition, miles, interior condition and warranty to name a few. Our cars are priced in the condition that you see them. As with any used vehicle, they have been driven on the road, parked in garages and parking lots and driven through all kinds of weather. Some wear and tear is normal. This may include some small scratches or door dings, interior wear, chips in the windshield etc. We have taken all of these into consideration and priced the vehicles accordingly. All vehicles must pass North Carolina State inspection. Cars come with one key unless otherwise noted or disclosed. Not all cars have second keys. Not all cars have owners manuals. We will be happy to price any parts or repairs that you may desire at our wholesale cost and include them in the deal and in your financing. We have GM Certified vehicles here on the lot, they come with a factory backed extended limited warranty (see dealer for details). Some of our vehicles are still covered under the original factory warranty and are therefore sold with the balance of that warranty in place. Some of our vehicles are sold AS-IS, this means that the buyer is responsible for all repairs. Some vehicles will have open recalls, we will provide all paperwork and disclose any recalls to you before purchase.<br /><br />Awards:<br /> * JD Power Initial Quality Study (IQS)","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",118.25,

Derrow Shirkey Ford&#39;s Wholesale Open to Public is a select offering of used cars that have traditionally been sold at the auction to independent dealers and small used car lots. These are vehicles that fall outside of Derrow Shirkey Ford&#39;s used car guidelines. They are generally higher mileage, older, lower-priced vehicles that are perhaps &#39;flawed&#39; in some way. Some general guidelines for a wholesale vehicle: • They are sold without a warranty • They are offered for a limited time only - 30 days • They are sold 100% AS-IS without any warranty coverage • They are sold with our &#34;best price&#34; posted on the windshield. There is no negotiation necessary. Why Wholesale Open to Public? Simply put - our customers have requested that we make these vehicles available. Many of our customers have a need for basic transportation. By offering a broader selection of &#34;kid&#39;s cars&#34;, 2nd car, college cars, and other inexpensive transportation options, we feel we can better serve our current customers and the general market.<br /><br />We are located 2 miles South of the turnpike at exit 13. Our location makes it a very simple drive from Toledo, Fort Wayne, Hillsdale, Angola, Bryan, Defiance, Napoleon, or Jackson. OUR MISSION STATEMENT- We will be honest and transparent. Through teamwork, honesty and hard work, we will build trusting relationships with our customers, always striving to exceed their expectations. The same holds true for our team members as we constantly learn and improve from within ourselves and each other. Come see for yourself why Derrow-Shirkey Ford Lincoln is the fastest growing dealership in the tri-state area. We are committed to making the car buying experience fast, fun and easy!!! 1.
