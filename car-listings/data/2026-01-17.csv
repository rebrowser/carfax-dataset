We surveyed hundreds of our past clients to find out how they want to purchase a vehicle and we have listened. We designed a fast, fair, and simple process to save you time and eliminate the need for the back-and-forth that out clients have told us they dislike (or even hate!). You will find that we do things very different than you may have experienced in the past and have come to expect with other dealers. We call this: Simple Price, Simple Process! Our Simple Price will be the same regardless of where you see our vehicle. We do extensive research to know the market. We utilize the same reliable tools you may use (Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, Craigslist, etc), as well as some others (sales data, auction data, shopping our competition), to offer every vehicle at a very fair and aggressive market-based purchase price. We use this process for every vehicle, new and used, to eliminate the need for back-and-forth negotiations. Our clients have told us that this develops trust and the confidence to purchase.

It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane. Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.</li><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n Call Jack Burford Chevrolet, Inc. at 859-623-3350 to schedule your VIP test drive!

We believe if you want the vehicle we have to offer, you will want to buy it - no pressure needed. We are here to assist you. Our vehicles are priced based on condition, mileage, and demand. All the vehicles we offer for sale are priced to sell and offer exceptional value for money - our goal is NOT to have simply the LOWEST PRICE but to offer the best value. Please do not confuse low prices with value - if something is ""cheap"" there is normally a reason and no two used cars are the same - so please call to discuss or test drive any of our vehicles with the understanding that we may not have the lowest price but our goal is to offer the best value for the price.

One Owner! \n\n <b>OTHER NOTABLE FEATURES AND OPTIONS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT:</b>\n\n\n\nSafety and Security<ul><li> Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane. Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.</li><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li></ul>\n\nGRAPHITE, LEATHER SEAT MATERIAL\n\n At Holler Hyundai, all of our vehicles are clearly marked with our haggle-free best price and our sales associates are commission-free.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life.

Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them.

It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control.

When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them.

It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control.

When you need the extra space for cargo rather than kids, you&#39;ll love the manual fold-into-floor second row seats. Just pull the release and manual fold into floor second-row seats disappear for more room in the back, without hurting your back.</li><li> Stow &#39;n Go manual fold-into-floor folding second-row seats</li><li> Heated steering wheel - A warm touch. Trying to drive with bulky winter gloves on isn&#39;t always easy. Keep your hands warm in cold temperatures so you can ditch the mitts and get a firm grip with this heated steering wheel.</li><li> Heated driver and front passenger seat cushions - That&#39;s hot. Heated driver and front passenger seat cushions provide more targeted warmth so you can get comfortable quicker in cold weather. If you have lower body pain, you might also be soothed by the heat while you drive.

It doesn&#39;t matter how long your drive is, if you aren&#39;t comfortable while you&#39;re behind the wheel, every trip feels like a chore. With 8-way driver seat, finding the perfect position is easy, so you can sit back, (or up, or a little forward), relax and enjoy the journey.</li><li> Front passenger seat with 4-way directional controls</li><li> Heated driver and front passenger seat cushions - That&#39;s hot.

When your arms are full of cargo, the last thing you want to do is set it all down just to open the liftgate, then pick it all back up to load it in. By remotely opening and closing, power liftgate lets you skip straight to the loading. It also eliminates the awkward stretch to reach up for the liftgate to close it. Load and go with power open and close liftgate.</li><li> Keyfob engine start control - Get an early start. Remotely start your vehicle&#39;s engine from the key fob, ensuring your ride is ready to go when you get in. Now you can stay comfortable inside while your vehicle gets comfortable outside, thanks to Keyfob engine start control.</li><li> Keyfob cargo access control - Load up without the set down. With keyfob cargo access control, packing up your vehicle is easy.

With just a push of a button, the cargo area is ready for your stuff. Keyfob cargo access control helps you take a load off.</li><li> Distance pacing cruise control with traffic stop-go. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with Distance pacing cruise control with traffic stop-go, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and the vehicle ahead. It&#39;s stop/go feature automatically brings the vehicle to a stop if traffic stops and resumes distance pacing cruise when traffic starts to move again. Distance pacing cruise control with traffic stop-go, your ultimate co-pilot.</li><li> Cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful, until cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed using the steering wheel mounted controls and it will maintain that speed without driver intervention. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Blind spot warning - Protect your blind side. You checked the mirror, looked over your shoulder and still nearly collided with the car next to you. Blind spot warning alerts you to the presence of a vehicle to your sides or rear so you know if you&#39;re about to make an unsafe lane change. Replace fear and uncertainty with confidence and safety with blind spot warning.</li><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane. Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li><li> Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring</li><li> Wireless connectivity - Strike the cord. Wireless technology makes it easy to place calls without having to fumble with your phone. It integrates your device with the system inside your vehicle for hands-free access. Keep connected and keep your hands on the wheel with wireless connectivity.</li><li> 10 USB ports - No adaptor needed! You need a charge. You want to hear your music. But your adapter is lost and all you have is a USB cord. That&#39;s A-Okay - with 10 USB ports, you can connect, power up and go.</li></ul>\n\n\n While reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy of vehicle descriptions, dealer is not responsible for errors or omission regarding specific equipment, features, packages or details.

Just pull the release and manual fold into floor second-row seats disappear for more room in the back, without hurting your back.</li><li> Manual fold into floor second-row seat - Room to move! When you need the extra space for cargo rather than kids, you&#39;ll love the manual fold-into-floor second row seats. Just pull the release and manual fold into floor second-row seats disappear for more room in the back, without hurting your back.</li><li> Stow &#39;n Go manual fold-into-floor folding second-row seats</li><li> Heated steering wheel - A warm touch. Trying to drive with bulky winter gloves on isn&#39;t always easy. Keep your hands warm in cold temperatures so you can ditch the mitts and get a firm grip with this heated steering wheel.</li><li> Heated driver and front passenger seat cushions - That&#39;s hot. Heated driver and front passenger seat cushions provide more targeted warmth so you can get comfortable quicker in cold weather. If you have lower body pain, you might also be soothed by the heat while you drive. No matter the weather, find comfort in heated driver and front passenger seat cushions.</li><li> This upholstery simulates leather, is durable and easy to keep clean.</li><li> 8-way driver seat - Comfort that conforms to you! It doesn&#39;t matter how long your drive is, if you aren&#39;t comfortable while you&#39;re behind the wheel, every trip feels like a chore. With 8-way driver seat, finding the perfect position is easy, so you can sit back, (or up, or a little forward), relax and enjoy the journey.</li><li> Front passenger seat with 4-way directional controls</li><li> Heated driver and front passenger seat cushions - That&#39;s hot.

When your arms are full of cargo, the last thing you want to do is set it all down just to open the liftgate, then pick it all back up to load it in. By remotely opening and closing, power liftgate lets you skip straight to the loading. It also eliminates the awkward stretch to reach up for the liftgate to close it. Load and go with power open and close liftgate.</li><li> Keyfob engine start control - Get an early start. Remotely start your vehicle&#39;s engine from the key fob, ensuring your ride is ready to go when you get in. Now you can stay comfortable inside while your vehicle gets comfortable outside, thanks to Keyfob engine start control.</li><li> Keyfob cargo access control - Load up without the set down. With keyfob cargo access control, packing up your vehicle is easy. The keyfob unlocks the cargo door or lid so you don&#39;t have to set your cargo down, unlock, then pick your cargo back up before you load it in. With just a push of a button, the cargo area is ready for your stuff. Keyfob cargo access control helps you take a load off.</li><li> Distance pacing cruise control with traffic stop-go. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with Distance pacing cruise control with traffic stop-go, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and the vehicle ahead. It&#39;s stop/go feature automatically brings the vehicle to a stop if traffic stops and resumes distance pacing cruise when traffic starts to move again. Distance pacing cruise control with traffic stop-go, your ultimate co-pilot.</li><li> Cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful, until cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed using the steering wheel mounted controls and it will maintain that speed without driver intervention. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Blind spot warning - Protect your blind side. You checked the mirror, looked over your shoulder and still nearly collided with the car next to you. Blind spot warning alerts you to the presence of a vehicle to your sides or rear so you know if you&#39;re about to make an unsafe lane change. Replace fear and uncertainty with confidence and safety with blind spot warning.</li><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane. Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li><li> Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring</li><li> Wireless connectivity - Strike the cord. Wireless technology makes it easy to place calls without having to fumble with your phone. It integrates your device with the system inside your vehicle for hands-free access. Keep connected and keep your hands on the wheel with wireless connectivity.</li><li> 10 USB ports - No adaptor needed! You need a charge. You want to hear your music. But your adapter is lost and all you have is a USB cord. That&#39;s A-Okay - with 10 USB ports, you can connect, power up and go.</li></ul>\n\n\n While reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy of vehicle descriptions, dealer is not responsible for errors or omission regarding specific equipment, features, packages or details.

Check out the following:\n\nNo Accidents! \nOne Owner! \n\n\nBLACK, LEATHER SEAT TRIM\n\nSafety and Security<ul><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane. Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li></ul>\nWheels: 19\&#39; Gloss Black Alloy, Express Open/Close Sliding And Tilting Glass 1st Row Sunroof w/Sunshade, Power Sliding Rear Doors, Perimeter/Approach Lights, 2 LCD Monitors In The Front, Cruise Control w/Steering Wheel Controls, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low-Speed Follow, Perimeter Alarm, 3 12V DC Power Outlets, Blind Spot Information (BSI) System Blind Spot, Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) &#43; Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Cross Traffic Monitor, Collision Mitigation-Front, Back-Up Camera\n We price our cars, not our Customers.
