You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead. * Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision. * Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn't by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that's both convenient and safe.=== Technology and Telematics === * Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle's infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you're looking for while keeping your eyes on the road. * Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly. Connect your devices to the Internet through your vehicle's private mobile hotspot and take the internet wherever your journey takes you, without eating up your data allowance.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane. Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li><li> Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly. Connect your devices to the Internet through your vehicle&#39;s private mobile hotspot and take the internet wherever your journey takes you, without eating up your data allowance.

The 5.3L engine is particularly popular for its Active Fuel Management technology, which deactivates cylinders under light loads to improve highway fuel economy to about 20-21 mpg.<br /><br />Responsive Handling:<br /> It was redesigned shortly before 2009 with a fully-boxed frame and rack-and-pinion steering, providing a much smoother, more controlled ride than older pickup generations. <br /><br />Durability and Reliability<br /><br />Proven Longevity: <br />Owners frequently report these trucks lasting over 200,000 miles with routine maintenance.<br /><br />Positive Consumer Sentiment: <br />Approximately 88% of owners recommend the vehicle, highlighting its reliability and comfort as standout features.<br /><br />Mechanical Simplicity:<br /> Compared to newer trucks with complex electronics, the 2009 model is often cited by DIY mechanics as being easier to work on and maintain. <br /><br />Nobody beats a VICTORY DEAL. 816-532-0900<br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",103.95,

This Colorado is powered by the sought-after 3.7L inline-five engine that produces 242 horsepower and 242 lb-ft of torque — an impressive balance of low-end torque for towing and passing and mid-range power for everyday driving. The powerplant is renowned for its durability and character, giving this truck a responsive feel whether navigating city streets or hauling a load on the highway. Low mileage and a clean history make this one especially attractive. With under 101,000 miles on the odometer (averaging less than 6,000 miles per year), this Colorado has been gently used and carefully maintained. It also comes with a clean CARFAX report and has been owned by a single owner, providing confidence in its documented background and service history. Overall condition is excellent — cosmetically tidy and mechanically sound — making it an ideal choice for someone seeking a dependable pickup with many years of useful service left. Exterior highlights - Classic Black paint with a glossy, well-preserved finish that presents attractively and resists showing road grime. Chrome-accented bumpers and grille on the LT trim add a refined touch to the rugged profile. - LT-specific alloy wheels complement the overall appearance and contribute to a composed ride. Tires are in great condition with plenty of tread remaining. - Functional bed area with a durable tailgate and factory-mounted tie-down points to secure cargo. The Colorado’s compact footprint makes it easy to maneuver in tight spaces while still offering a practical cargo bed for projects, gear, or weekend adventures. - Bright halogen headlamps and integrated signal lamps provide sure-footed lighting, and the aerodynamic body lines enhance both style and efficiency. Interior comfort and convenience - Ebony cloth seating that is both comfortable and hard-wearing — ideal for daily use, work, or family runs. The LT trim typically includes upgraded upholstery and trim accents compared with base models. - Thoughtfully laid-out driver controls: tilt steering wheel for a comfortable driving position, easy-to-read gauges, and an accessible center stack. - Power accessories: power windows and power door locks make daily convenience a given, and power-adjustable mirrors help with quick and precise sightlines. - Climate control: efficient air conditioning keeps the cabin comfortable in warm weather, while the heating system performs reliably on colder days. - Practical storage solutions: a central console with deep storage, multiple cup holders, a glovebox and door pockets provide places to stow things neatly. - Audio and connectivity: factory stereo system with AM/FM radio and CD playback plus auxiliary input provides entertainment and allows connection of external audio devices. Steering wheel-mounted audio controls (on many LT models) make it easy to keep attention on the road. Performance and economy - The 3.7L I5 offers 242 hp and 242 lb-ft of torque — a well-rounded output that gives confident acceleration and useful low-end strength for towing moderate loads or merging on highways. - Fuel economy is respectable for a truck of this size: approximately 17 MPG city and 23 MPG highway. These figures make it an economical choice for those who need truck capability without frequent fuel stops. - The chassis and suspension deliver a comfortable, controlled ride. The Colorado’s nimble handling and compact dimensions make it an easy truck to drive in suburban and urban settings while still capable on rural roads. Safety and driver aids - Standard safety features include dual front airbags, and side-impact airbags enhance occupant protection. Anti-lock brakes (ABS) and electronic traction/stability control systems available on LT models help maintain control in various driving conditions. - Tire pressure mon","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",194.1,
