You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane. Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n To be sure you don&#39;t miss out, give us a call at 407-645-1234 and schedule a test drive.

We surveyed hundreds of our past clients to find out how they want to purchase a vehicle and we have listened. We designed a fast, fair, and simple process to save you time and eliminate the need for the back-and-forth that out clients have told us they dislike (or even hate!). You will find that we do things very different than you may have experienced in the past and have come to expect with other dealers. We call this: Simple Price, Simple Process! Our Simple Price will be the same regardless of where you see our vehicle. We do extensive research to know the market. We utilize the same reliable tools you may use (Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, Craigslist, etc), as well as some others (sales data, auction data, shopping our competition), to offer every vehicle at a very fair and aggressive market-based purchase price. We use this process for every vehicle, new and used, to eliminate the need for back-and-forth negotiations. Our clients have told us that this develops trust and the confidence to purchase. This saves our clients time (in some cases even hours or days of negotiation) and provides the 100% transparent experience our clients tell us they want.<br /><br />From your first contact with us (call, text, email or store visit), to the time you drive away in your new vehicle, our Simple Price and Simple Process will save you time. You will work with only one person from beginning to end. Your professional Sales Manager will present the vehicle you have selected and offer to share any others that are similar. Once you have selected the vehicle you would like to own, there is no need to negotiate. In addition, Toyota Sunnyvale’s Simple Process has been streamlined by eliminating the wait for the “Finance Department,” saving you an hour (or two) to see a finance manager. Your Sales Manager invests an additional 30&#43; hours per year of training to professionally offer your protection options. They already know you and what will provide the maximum benefits during your ownership so they will tailor your experience to the items best suited to you.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",143.45,

Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful, until cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed using the steering wheel mounted controls and it will maintain that speed without driver intervention. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li><li> Blind spot warning - Protect your blind side. You checked the mirror, looked over your shoulder and still nearly collided with the car next to you. Blind spot warning alerts you to the presence of a vehicle to your sides or rear so you know if you&#39;re about to make an unsafe lane change. Replace fear and uncertainty with confidence and safety with blind spot warning.</li><li> Rear collision warning - It has your back. This system uses sensors to monitor the area behind you. If it senses an impending crash, it alerts you so you can take steps to prevent a collision or reduce the severity of it. Rear collision warning, a second set off eyes watching over you.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car.
