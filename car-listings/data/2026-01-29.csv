Note that this program can also apply to vehicles where the remaining factory coverage is less than 6 months or 6,000 miles. Please check the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Buyers guide on the vehicle for full details as to whether or not warranty coverage may apply. Contact Dealer for additional details. The Wyler Assurance 6 month/6,000 Mile limited warranty ends 6 months from the date of the Retail Purchase Agreement (BUYERS ORDER) or when the vehicle's odometer registers 6,000 additional miles to the mileage listed on the BUYERS ORDER, whichever comes first.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Android Auto/Apple CarPlay smart device wireless mirroring</li><li> Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring</li><li> Wireless Apple CarPlay/Wireless Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring</li></ul>\n\nOther Options/Features\n\nEMISSIONS, FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS, ENGINE, 6.2L ECOTEC3 V8, TRANSMISSION, 10-SPEED AUTOMATIC WITH ELECTRONIC PRECISION SHIFT, ELECTRONICALLY CONTROLLED, GVWR, 7000 LBS.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Active blind spot system - Protect your blind side. You checked the mirror, looked over your shoulder and still nearly collided with the car next to you. An active blind spot system not only alerts you to the presence of a vehicle to your sides or rear but helps prevent you from making an unsafe lane change. Replace fear and uncertainty with the confidence and safety of the Active blind spot system.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly. Connect your devices to the Internet through your vehicle&#39;s private mobile hotspot and take the internet wherever your journey takes you, without eating up your data allowance.

(Unsure whether it's aftermarket or not) Why are partitions (AKA bulkheads) so important? Van partitions do more than just block the view or reduce the noise of the cargo. When you install a van partition, you're also taking advantage of these benefits: Partitions save lives: The primary purpose of a partition is to protect the driver and passenger from shifting cargo in the event of a hard stop or accident. Increased driver comfort: A partition helps retain the climate control in the cab rather than escaping to the back. Separate the cargo area: The right partition will help prevent odors, dust, and other materials from coming into the cab. Increased security: Without a partition, one of the easiest routes for a criminal to your tools in the rear is through the cab windows. Ford's Co-Pilot360 package of driver assistance systems is standard and includes: Forward collision mitigation (warns you of an impending collision and applies the brakes in certain scenarios) Lane departure mitigation (warns you of a lane departure when a turn signal isn't used and can automatically steer to maintain lane position) Driver attention warning (issues an alert if sensors determine you are becoming fatigued) Automatic high-beam headlights The ten-speed transmission offers a 20% decrease in RPM during shifting. While towing, decreased ratio distance ensures smoother shifts. It offers great efficiency, and performance, while all in all optimizing fuel economy.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-off cruise control - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-off cruise control.</li><li> Super Cruise (3-year subscription) hands-on cruise control with lane change</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring</li></ul>\n\nENGINE, DURAMAX 3.0L TURBO-DIESEL I6, ONYX BLACK \n <b>WHY BUY FROM MATT NIMEY GMC?</b>\nAt <b>Matt Nimey GMC</b>, we believe that buying a vehicle should be easy, transparent, and built around your needs.
