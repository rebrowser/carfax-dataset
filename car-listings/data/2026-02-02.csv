This unassuming Volvo hatchback is such an introvert, it might suffer from social anxiety. Indeed, merely looking at the V60 Polestar won’t be enough to let most observers grasp exactly what it is. To clear things up, it is a $62,595 wagon sized toward the small end of the mid-size class, which has been given a performance makeover by Volvo’s in-house tuning arm, Polestar. The Polestar is exceedingly rare, with Volvo building just 750 sedans and wagons annually since its introduction for 2015. For 2018, Volvo has chucked that engine, along with its aging six-speed automatic transaxle, in favor of a 362-hp turbo- and supercharged 2.0-liter inline-four and an eight-speed automatic.

It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane. Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.</li><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly. Connect your devices to the Internet through your vehicle&#39;s private mobile hotspot and take the internet wherever your journey takes you, without eating up your data allowance. Find the hotspot with mobile hotspot.</li></ul> \n\nTo be sure you don&#39;t miss out, why not give us a call at 610-399-1300 and schedule a test drive.

We are proud to offer this WHITE 2018 Volvo V90 Cross Country 5DR T5 WGN AWD to you today for only $21,999 This V90 Cross Country has the following options: Safety and Security Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That's when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead. Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don't always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision. Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control. Technology and Telematics Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle's infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you're looking for while keeping your eyes on the road. Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly. Connect your devices to the Internet through your vehicle's private mobile hotspot and take the internet wherever your journey takes you, without eating up your data allowance. Find the hotspot with mobile hotspot. To be sure you don't miss out, why not give us a call at 610-399-1300 and schedule a test drive. We are located at 1290 Wilmington Pike, West Chester PA 19382. We look forward to seeing you soon.Plus, tax, dealer DOC fee of $477.00, title registration.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",120.5,"Accident reported"

This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li></ul>\n \n<b>About Dublin Honda</b>\nNot only are we Honda enthusiasts at Dublin Honda, we&#39;re dedicated members of the local community.

Someone without an income or way to afford the payments, won't qualify. Someone who had, on a regular basis, borrowed money and failed to pay it back, won't qualify. To clarify If a person cannot or likely will not pay for the vehicle, they are not going to get a loan. Loaning them money would be stupid. We are not stupid. If there really is someone that thinks they can get a car loan when they don’t have the ability to repay the loan, then they are stupid too. We cannot fix stupid. However If you are a reasonable person with bad credit, a reasonable down payment and a way to repay a loan, then we can get you that loan. Come on down you won't get shoved around!

Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li><li> Electronic stability control - Helping you stay grounded. By monitoring and comparing vehicle dynamics to driver input, this system acts instantly to help control the vehicle if it loses traction. It engages the traction control and anti-lock brake systems if skidding is detected, and it may even react well before you&#39;re aware of a loss of traction.

With hill hold control, the vehicle automatically applies brake force to prevent itself from rolling back.

As such, the Outback competes with family cars, SUVs and, of course, other crossover vehicles. With a base price just short of $25,000, the Outback should be affordable enough for families considering a new Camry or Accord. With better off-road credentials and a more usable luggage compartment, the Outback offers increased versatility over plain Jane family sedans. At the same time, the Subaru Outback offers the kind of fuel economy that most mid-sized SUVs struggle to match.Interesting features of this model are fuel-efficient transmissions, standard all-wheel drive, good ground clearance, Versatility, and spacious interior<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",188.5,"Moderate damage"
