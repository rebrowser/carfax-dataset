Under the hood (well, under the small bonnet) is Toyota’s famous Hybrid Synergy Drive pairing a 1.5L Hybrid I4 (76 hp, 82 ft-lbs torque from the gasoline engine) with electric assist and an electronically controlled continuously variable transmission (ECVT). Translation: silent creep in EV mode, smooth acceleration, and regenerative braking that harvests energy every time you pretend to be aggressive in traffic but actually lift off the gas. Factory-standard features (the stuff it rolled off the assembly line with, not aftermarket gizmos): - Hybrid Synergy Drive system with regenerative braking, EV mode capability, and eco-minded engineering to squeeze maximum MPG from every commute. - Center-mounted multi-information display showing instantaneous and average fuel economy, hybrid energy flow, trip information and range — perfect for the nerd who loves watching numbers drop into the green zone. - Efficient heating and ventilation with manual A/C controls and a comfortable Dark Gray cloth interior that’s easy to live with and surprisingly forgiving of coffee threats. - AM/FM radio with a single-disc CD player and auxiliary inputs for your music stash (no Bluetooth sorcery required). - Power windows, power door locks and remote keyless entry — because fumbling for keys is so 2006. - Tilt steering wheel and cruise control for highway zen. - 60/40 split-folding rear seats to expand cargo space when impulse Ikea runs or weekend-errand heroics call. - 15-inch wheels with wheel covers, rear hatch with wiper, and a compact, practical cargo area — the small-but-capable hybrid hatch formula. - Safety systems include antilock brakes (ABS) with electronic brake-force distribution, traction control and Toyota’s suite of airbags (front and front-seat side airbags plus side curtain protection), plus child-seat LATCH anchors — proof this car is more responsible than most of us on a Monday morning. This particular Prius has clocked under 61,000 miles — that’s averaging less than 4,000 miles per year — so it’s been driven like a well-behaved pensioner rather than an aspiring rally car. Fuel economy is the real headline: EPA-ish numbers of about 48 MPG city and 45 MPG highway, which means fewer stops for gas and more stops for snacks instead. Cosmetically and mechanically this Prius is in excellent overall condition — clean exterior Super White paint, tidy Dark Gray cloth cabin, and the sort of low-mileage demeanor that makes you feel like you found a unicorn that runs on electricity and common sense. If you want a dependable, economical, slightly smug-looking hybrid that laughs silently at the gas pump, this Prius is waiting — and it won’t complain if you play the radio too loudly.

This Crystal Black Silica beauty with Carbon Black leather trim was purchased in Kentucky from the widow of the elderly gentleman who bought it brand new. As you’d expect from a southern car, it’s rust-free and clean inside and out. Equipped with Subaru’s legendary all-wheel drive and a 5-speed manual transmission, this WRX is an absolute blast to drive. This vehicle does have a few tasteful performance upgrades already in place, including an aftermarket exhaust, upgraded suspension, and cold air intake (exact brands unknown), and it runs and drives excellent. We’ve also replaced the original tires due to age, so it’s ready for the road. It comes with a perfect, accident-free Carfax, along with all keys, remotes, and factory floor mats. If you’ve been searching for a low-mile WRX wagon with a clean, one owner, accident free history, this one checks a lot of boxes. For more info on this little Subie, contact Kevin at Mashburn Motors.

One of those is “relationship.” With every introduction, we are looking, not for a single transaction, but to “develop” a relationship with our customers...not just a good relationship, but an “outstanding” relationship that will outlast your car. Another key element is that “everybody wins”. In a time when most people believe winners create losers, we endeavor to satisfy everybody involved. It means knowing our product well and our customer even better. It means listening and caring and understanding that people buy their second-most expensive item from people they trust. Whether you are a car enthusiast, or you just need a reliable ride, the right car for you means buying exactly what you need and ideally what you want. Over forty years ago, we entered the automobile business driven by a passion for people, and recognizing cars as a “vehicle” for creating meaningful connections. We also understood that helping people select, purchase and finance one of the most important tools of your daily life is a valuable pursuit. Our priority is and has always been making sure your new or used-car buying experience is both satisfying and successful. Within the Cardinale Automotive Group, we know that satisfying a wide range of needs requires a diversity of quality cars. We offer new Audi, BMW, GMC, Harley Davidson, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan, Toyota and Volkswagen cars, along with used cars, trucks and SUVs by top manufacturers. We are committed to helping you find the right car, assisting you in choosing the right financing options, and becoming your trusted automobile dealer. Our relationship begins with our introduction and continues through the purchase, the financing, the service of the car and beyond.

Please use the listed price as the most up to date price. This vehicle has a notation on the Carfax that it was reacquired by the manufacturer. Simply put, the customer had a complaint about the vehicle and asked the manufacturer to take the car back. As a result, the trade value or selling price you will get for this vehicle is likely to be lower than for a similar vehicle that was not reacquired. This is reflected in the price you are paying for the vehicle now and why the vehicle is less expensive than a similar one that was not reacquired. In time, the difference in value between this vehicle and a normal vehicle will shrink. Therefore, if you plan to keep the vehicle for an extended period of time you will likely capture more of the savings of the lower price than if you sell or trade the vehicle within a short period after purchasing it. Solid and stately, this 2024 Chevrolet Corvette will envelope you in well- engineered charm and security.

The panoramic moonroof, 19&#34; alloy wheels, and upscale exterior accents give the Rogue a refined, modern look. Inside, the Almond interior provides a warm, inviting cabin with intuitive technology, including Nissan Door‑to‑Door Navigation, Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and NissanConnect Services. Safety is a standout with Nissan’s full suite of driver‑assist features—ProPILOT Assist, Intelligent Cruise Control, Automatic Emergency Braking, Blind Spot Warning, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, and the Intelligent Around View Monitor for 360° visibility. With its comfort, efficiency, and advanced safety technology, the Rogue SL remains one of the most well‑rounded compact SUVs on the road.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",141,"Minor to moderate damage"

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Rear camera with washer - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. Even if there are sloppy conditions, the washer keeps the camera&#39;s view clean. Rear camera with washer is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring</li><li> Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly. Connect your devices to the Internet through your vehicle&#39;s private mobile hotspot and take the internet wherever your journey takes you, without eating up your data allowance.

The CARFAX report shows it&#39;s only been owned by one owner. Today&#39;s luxury vehicle is not just about opulence. It&#39;s about a perfect balance of performance, comfort and attention to detail. This 2017 E 300 is the perfect example of the modern luxury. This low mileage E-Class has barely been touched. It&#39;s the next best thing to buying new. You&#39;ll quickly realize how much you will need a navigation system once you are stopping for directions or looking up addresses on your phone instead of looking at the road. This Mercedes-Benz E 300 Luxury features a navigation system that will free you of these unnecessary headaches. High-performance tires are another option found on this vehicle. More information about the 2017 Mercedes-Benz E-Class: The Mercedes Benz E-Class is a mid-sized luxury car, in competition with Audi&#39;s A6 sedan, BMW&#39;s 5-Series and the Lexus GS. All offer plenty of space, with an array of powerful engines, but none offer the kind of refinement and ease of operation that the new E-Class has. The E-Class also offers great fuel economy for a luxury vehicle, making due (in E300 guise) with a turbocharged 4-cylinder while most of its competitors use bigger and thirstier engines. While the engine in the E300 is small, thanks to turbocharging and an advanced transmission, acceleration remains competitive. Interesting features of this model are powerful, but fuel efficient engine, semi-autonomous driver assist systems, Luxurious ride, available all-wheel drive, technology laden features, and spacious interior<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",173.7,
