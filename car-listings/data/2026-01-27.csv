Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful, until cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed using the steering wheel mounted controls and it will maintain that speed without driver intervention. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Selective Internet access - a more focused delivery. Selective internet access allows you to tailor the features for your feed, such as sports scores, local news, or current weather. When it comes to getting what you want, selective internet access is a net gain.</li><li> Voice activated integrated navigation system - A to B made easy! Whether it&#39;s an errand or a road trip, the voice activated integrated navigation system will guide you to your destination. No more bulky, impossible-to-fold maps, and no more stopping to ask for directions. Just tell it where you want to go, and the voice activated integrated navigation system shows you the right way.</li></ul>\n\n ** Every vehicle we offer comes equipped with 3 year monitoring from LoJack for the additional price of $795.

Powertrain & Performance - Factory 3.8L V6 delivering a hearty 311 hp and 293 ft-lbs of torque — enough shove to make you smile at stoplights. - Smooth-shifting automatic transmission (factory-calibrated for effortless highway passing and civilized cruising). - Real-world fuel economy: about 18 MPG city / 29 MPG highway — practical enough for daily life, peppy enough for the fun parts. Factory-Equipped Features (the good stuff that came from the factory, not aftermarket duct tape) - Luxurious Black leather seating straight from the factory — comfortable, classy, and easy to clean after life’s little spills. - Power-adjustable front seats with driver memory settings (factory convenience to stop the “where’d-I-leave-my-seat” squabble). - Heated front seats for those mornings that feel like the Arctic without warning. - Dual-zone automatic climate control so you and your passenger can wage tiny temperature wars independently. - Keyless entry and push-button start — because digging for keys is retro, and this car is not. - Bluetooth hands-free phone and audio streaming, plus steering-wheel-mounted audio and cruise controls for safe, convenient command. - AM/FM audio with CD and auxiliary/USB connectivity — modern meets analog for your curated playlist library. - Automatic headlights and well-designed exterior lighting for improved visibility and that “look” on the road. - Comprehensive factory safety suite: ABS, traction and stability control, multiple airbags (front, side, curtain), and tire pressure monitoring — all the basics you want keeping you honest and upright. - Solid build quality and refined suspension tuning — this is a luxury sedan that behaves like one. Condition & History - Excellent overall condition inside and out — this Genesis has been well cared for and it shows. - Clean CARFAX report — no drama, no mystery, just a clean history. - Mileage is under 103,000 miles, averaging less than 9,000 miles per year — a sensible, low-mileage lifestyle for a vehicle this age. Why this one? If you want a grown-up luxury sedan that still has some pep, looks great in Montecito Blue, and won’t demand soul-searching at the pump, this Genesis is worth a look. It’s polished, practical, and just a little smug in the best way — like a sports coat with sneakers.

Under the hood: a 4.4L Twin-Turbo V8 that delivers 445 horsepower and 480 lb-ft of torque, mated to a smooth 8-speed automatic transmission. It hustles when you want it to and relaxes when you don’t — 17 MPG city, 25 MPG highway, and surprisingly reasonable mileage for its class (under 86,000 miles total — that’s less than 8,000 miles per year on average). Eye candy and interior decadence - Exterior: Imperial Blue Metallic — deep, classy, and just the right amount of “I know what I’m doing.” - Interior: Ivory White and Black leather seating surfaces that contrast beautifully and feel like a private jet seat. Rich trim and tasteful chrome accents complete the executive vibe. - Comfort features include power-adjustable front seats with memory and lumbar support, premium leather upholstery, and a well-appointed cockpit that puts everything within reach. Factory-equipped luxury and tech (in plain English) - BMW iDrive infotainment system with generous display and rotary controller for navigation, audio, and vehicle settings — everything is where your brain expects it to be. - Factory navigation and voice control so your phone calls and directions don’t require interpretive dance. - Premium factory audio system to make your playlists sound like they had their own stylist. - Multi-zone automatic climate control so you and your passengers can wage a truce over temperature preferences. - Power sunroof/panoramic glass lets in just enough sky to feel worldly without ruining your hair. - Power trunk and keyless entry/start for when you’re hands-full or just dramatically approaching your car. - Adaptive driving modes (Comfort, Sport, Economy-minded options) so the car matches your mood — zen commuter or eager roadster. - Adaptive suspension and ride control that smooths out the road like a polite moderator at a heated meeting. - Parking sensors and back-up camera to save you from mailbox trauma. - Full complement of safety basics: ABS, traction and stability control, multiple airbags, and solid BMW engineering that has been doing this long enough to be smug about it. Condition & peace of mind - Excellent overall condition inside and out — this 7 Series was pampered. - SALVAGE CARFAX report ! - Low annual mileage for its age means more great years ahead. Why this one? If you want a flagship sedan that blends serious V8 power with living-room luxury and a hint of techy wizardry, this Imperial Blue 750i with Ivory/Black leather is essentially a four-wheeled velvet rope. It’s polished, powerful, and practical enough to be your daily driver — with the muscle to remind everyone at the light that you do mean business. Ready to meet your new commute’s new boss?

Under the hood is the punchy EcoBoost 2.0L Turbo I4, delivering a very respectable 240 hp and 270 lb-ft of torque. Paired with a smooth 6-speed automatic transmission and standard front-wheel drive (all-wheel drive was available on some trims), this MKZ brings surprising pep while still being sensible: it averages 22 MPG city and 33 MPG highway. With under 60,000 miles (that’s less than 5,000 miles per year), a clean CARFAX and excellent overall condition, this one is as close to a time capsule as a daily-driver luxury sedan gets — without the dust. Factory-standard features you’ll actually use (and appreciate) - Comfort and trim: Light Dune leather-trimmed seating, power-adjustable front seats with lumbar support, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel. Rear seats fold 60/40 to add practicality when you need it, so your grocery run or weekend IKEA conquest is covered. - Climate and convenience: Dual-zone automatic climate control keeps the driver and passenger from arguing over the thermostat. Power windows, power door locks, and remote keyless entry are standard, along with push-button start for that “luxury without the fuss” feeling. - Infotainment and connectivity: Lincoln’s infotainment system (SYNC/MyLincoln Touch era) with a central display provides Bluetooth hands-free calling and audio streaming, USB and auxiliary inputs, and intuitive steering-wheel audio controls. AM/FM and satellite radio capability mean you’ll never be short on listening options. - Safety and driver aids: Built with a full suite of factory safety equipment — multiple airbags (front, side and curtain), anti-lock brakes (ABS), traction control and electronic stability control — the MKZ was designed to look after occupants. Rear-view camera and parking aids were offered to make parking less of a dramatic event. Advanced features like blind-spot monitoring, cross-traffic alert, adaptive cruise control or collision mitigation were available on higher trims/options. - Exterior and lighting: The White Platinum Metallic Tri-Coat finish gives the MKZ a refined, showroom-ready look. Factory exterior touches include power heated mirrors, halogen projector headlights (HID lighting was available on some packages), and stylish alloy wheels that complement the Lincoln grille and chrome accents. - Luxury add-ons often found on these models: sunroof/moonroof, adaptive suspension, upgraded premium audio (Revel by Harman on some units), navigation, and active park assist — handy if parallel parking gives you the willies. Why this one stands out (besides the color combo) - Low mileage: under 60,000 miles, averaging less than 5,000 miles per year — this MKZ has been lightly used and well cared for. - Clean CARFAX: no accidents or title issues — just straightforward, honest ownership history. - Excellent overall condition: cosmetically and mechanically ready to make a new owner very happy. If you want a luxury sedan that manages to be both composed and fun (without guzzling premium gas like it’s trying to impress someone), this MKZ is a smart, stylish pick. It’s the kind of car that says “I take my comfort seriously” but still enjoys getting up and going when you do — and with mileage this low, it’s got plenty of getting-up-and-going left. 7 Star Auto Sales 5000 Madison Ave SACRAMENTO, CA 95841 (916) 545-2255 7 Star Auto Sales is a used car dealership located in Sacramento, CA, known for offering a wide selection of quality pre-owned vehicles.

At this price point, competitors often charge extra for similar equipment, making the Altima SR a smart money decision for maximizing feature content per dollar.<br /><br />Analytical buyers who demand clear value will appreciate the Altima SR’s generous standard features, safety technologies, and sport-inspired design. Those who compare spec sheets will find the SR trim delivers upgraded wheels, power driver seat, and premium convenience without costly add-ons. This sedan appeals to shoppers wanting maximum equipment at a competitive ownership cost.<br /><br />The Altima SR delivers solid performance with a fuel-efficient 2.5L engine mated to an Xtronic CVT, providing a strong balance of 188 horsepower and up to 34 highway mpg. This translates to real-world savings at the pump—averaging about 29 mpg combined—while maintaining responsive acceleration. Maintenance costs remain low due to Nissan’s proven powertrain reliability, protecting long-term value.<br /><br />Safety value is a standout, as the Altima SR includes Blind Spot Warning, Rear Parking Sensors, Brake Assist, and multiple airbags as standard—features that are often optional on rivals. Electronic Stability Control, ABS, and automatic high-beam headlights further enhance on-road safety. These systems function seamlessly to help prevent collisions and increase driver confidence, all included in the base price.<br /><br />Beyond core equipment, the Altima SR features a power moonroof, dual-zone climate control, sport steering wheel, and heated front seats, elevating comfort without requiring premium packages. SiriusXM, six speakers, and steering wheel audio controls ensure entertainment is standard. The trunk organizer tray and split-folding rear seats add flexible cargo utility, while the NissanConnect infotainment system offers easy smartphone integration.<br /><br />When compared to the Toyota Camry SE and Honda Accord Sport, the Altima SR includes more standard safety tech and convenience features for the price. While others may require costly packages for heated seats or blind spot monitoring, this sedan delivers these features up front. The result is a better feature-to-price ratio, maximizing value without sacrificing quality or comfort.<br /><br />Standard equipment in the Altima SR includes heated front seats, Blind Spot Warning, a power driver seat, and 19-inch wheels. This vehicle is worth the price due to its above-class standard content and efficient operation. The SR trim is the best value, as it combines sport styling and tech at no extra charge. While competitors charge extra for safety tech, here it&#39;s included as standard.<br /><br />Bayway Chevrolet invites you to experience the Altima SR’s value in person. Visit us at 5719 Broadway St, Pearland, TX, 77581 or call 281-719-9821 to schedule your test drive and discover how you can maximize your investment without compromising on quality or features.

It’s powered by Honda’s fuel-sipping 1.8L 4-cylinder paired with an automatic transmission, and since it’s FWD it’s easygoing in winter while still giving you great MPG for commuting. History-wise, it shows only 3 previous owners and 11 documented service history records, plus it’s exactly the kind of low-drama car that just starts every day, gets you where you’re going, and doesn’t ask for much in return. Inside, this LX trim is all about practicality done right — comfortable cloth seating, ice-cold A/C, a clean straightforward dash layout, and a trunk that’s honestly huge for how compact the car is. You also get the stuff people actually care about in a daily: power windows/locks, cruise control (major for highway driving), solid factory audio, and a driver-friendly seating position with excellent visibility. This is the perfect “first car,” “commuter,” or “work car” setup — light, easy to maneuver, and cheap on brakes/tires/gas compared to almost anything else. Price excludes tax, title, license, and service fee. Please contact dealer to verify all standard and optional equipment. This vehicle compares to Toyota Corolla, Mazda3, and Hyundai Elantra.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",131.9,

Under the hood lives the brand’s signature turbocharged inline-six, an engine that delivers a deep well of torque, silk-smooth power delivery, and that unmistakable BMW growl when you lean into the throttle. Paired with the automatic transmission and BMW’s xDrive all-wheel-drive system, it puts its power down confidently in all seasons without dulling the car’s athletic edge. On the road, the 335i still feels purpose-built. Steering is precise, the chassis feels balanced and planted, and the suspension strikes that classic BMW compromise—firm enough to entertain, compliant enough to live with every day. Alloy wheels fill the arches just right, giving the car a stance that’s sporty without trying too hard. Inside, it’s a familiar BMW formula done well. Supportive seats with heating add everyday comfort, the driving position is spot-on, and everything falls naturally to hand. It’s a cockpit designed for people who actually enjoy driving, not just commuting. This example sweetens the deal with a clean CarFax and just 77,000 miles, refreshingly low for a car that was engineered to rack up many more. In a world increasingly dominated by numb crossovers and overstyled tech showcases, the 2011 335i xDrive stands out as a genuinely engaging, premium sport sedan that still knows what it’s supposed to be.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",150.4,

Derrow Shirkey Ford&#39;s Wholesale Open to Public is a select offering of used cars that have traditionally been sold at the auction to independent dealers and small used car lots. These are vehicles that fall outside of Derrow Shirkey Ford&#39;s used car guidelines. They are generally higher mileage, older, lower-priced vehicles that are perhaps &#39;flawed&#39; in some way. Some general guidelines for a wholesale vehicle: • They are sold without a warranty • They are offered for a limited time only - 30 days • They are sold 100% AS-IS without any warranty coverage • They are sold with our &#34;best price&#34; posted on the windshield. There is no negotiation necessary. Why Wholesale Open to Public? Simply put - our customers have requested that we make these vehicles available. Many of our customers have a need for basic transportation. By offering a broader selection of &#34;kid&#39;s cars&#34;, 2nd car, college cars, and other inexpensive transportation options, we feel we can better serve our current customers and the general market.<br /><br />We are located 2 miles South of the turnpike at exit 13. Our location makes it a very simple drive from Toledo, Fort Wayne, Hillsdale, Angola, Bryan, Defiance, Napoleon, or Jackson. OUR MISSION STATEMENT- We will be honest and transparent. Through teamwork, honesty and hard work, we will build trusting relationships with our customers, always striving to exceed their expectations. The same holds true for our team members as we constantly learn and improve from within ourselves and each other. Come see for yourself why Derrow-Shirkey Ford Lincoln is the fastest growing dealership in the tri-state area. We are committed to making the car buying experience fast, fun and easy!!! 1. Pricing - We post our best price on every vehicle, every day. Period. 2. Trade In’s - We’ll make you a cash offer. No-Nonsense. We will buy your vehicle regardless if you purchase from us or not. 3. Financing - Multiple quotes in minutes. 4. No Surprises - We will gladly provide a history report and a copy of any repairs we performed on the vehicle. 5. Long Distance, No Problem! - We sell vehicles from New York to California.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",82.6,

It’s powered by the proven 3.5L V6 paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, giving it that effortless highway power and the classic Taurus ride quality that feels stable, quiet, and confident at any speed. And this one checks the big boxes buyers actually care about: the CARFAX shows a 1-owner, clean history with no accidents, plus documented service records including a recent oil & filter change. Even better, the CARFAX Reliability Forecast rates it as “Good Reliability” compared to similar vehicles, citing regular oil changes and strong long-term ownership expectations — which is exactly what you want backing up a daily-driver sedan like this. Inside, this Taurus is genuinely loaded — like surprisingly loaded. The Rapid Spec 202A (SYNC voice-activated system, Sony premium audio system w/12 speakers, rear view camera, reverse sensing system, push-button start, ambient interior lighting, power adjustable pedals) gives you a big chunk of the “modern car” experience without the modern car payment. Add in heated leather seating and a power moonroof, and it ends up feeling way more upscale than most sedans in this price range. Everything is laid out nicely, easy to use, and the cabin has that comfortable, quiet Taurus feel that makes you want to keep driving instead of rushing to park it. Price excludes tax, title, license, and service fee. Please contact dealer to verify all standard and optional equipment. This vehicle compares to Chevrolet Impala, Toyota Avalon, and Hyundai Azera.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",157.6,

We buy quality well maintained vehicles. (Local individuals & Franchise auctions)We avoid vehilces that have bad reliability ratings. Even though a lot of those vehicles are profitable, we still avoid them like the plague except on super rare occasions. For example, you will never see Hyundai, Kia, Nissans 2019 or older (Bad transmissions), Chevy Traverse/GMC Acadia (Most model years), Poorly maintained BMWs, AUDIs, RANGE ROVERs, etc. We simply refuse to sell vehicles that are likely to be a bad investment for our clients. If, on rare occasion we take one on trade we list it because we feel strongly about its quality and we will most definitely recommend our warranty partner AUL (One of the best warranty companies nationwide)We have certified and highly experienced mechanics that carefully inspect, road test and service our vehicles. We don't just wash them and put them for sale. We genuinly do our best to give you true quality. We spend a fortune on gas to drive our vehicles for 50 to 100 even 200 miles if we have to to make sure we complete 2 drive cycles before we get a 3rd party state inspection station to inspect them. Warranty is nice but doesn't work if anything happens in the first 30 days, no worries. We are very transparent with our agreements so as long as we did not already disclose it or agree on it prior to the sale and you some how despite of everything we did still get a check engine light, your AC stops working for example or transmmission goes out (One in a million chance) we still got your back. If the deal qualifies for the our 30 day gaurantee then we will take care of you.Much more to list, just know that once you join the family you will never shop anywhere else. *The advertised down payments are meant to be a rough estimate because it's the #1 question everyone calls about. You never know what it is until you speak with us, we chat about it to figure out your unique situation and finally fillout a credit application for us to geniunly shop you the best possible deal Call us, it won't take long, we promise.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",152.5,

Powered by a 1.8L four-cylinder engine paired with a smooth automatic transmission, it delivers excellent gas mileage while remaining easy to drive for daily commuting. The LE trim includes features such as a touchscreen infotainment system, Bluetooth connectivity, backup camera, adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and automatic emergency braking, providing a strong balance of technology and safety. With a spacious cabin for its class, a refined driving experience, and Toyota’s reputation for long-term dependability, the Corolla LE is a practical and cost-effective sedan for a wide range of drivers. This vehicle has had two prior owners, beginning as a rental and subsequently transitioning to personal ownership, which is a common and well-documented ownership pattern. It was last owned in Illinois and currently shows a relatively low odometer reading of 83,968 miles for its ownership history. With a recorded service history on file, the vehicle demonstrates traceable maintenance and responsible use, supporting its overall appeal as a well-managed and reliable option.

The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now!

Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back!
