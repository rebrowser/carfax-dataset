You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li><li> Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly. Connect your devices to the Internet through your vehicle&#39;s private mobile hotspot and take the internet wherever your journey takes you, without eating up your data allowance.

The 2019 model year was notable as it introduced a major powertrain upgrade and minor styling refresh, making it a highly competitive choice in the segment. Performance and Drivetrain The 2019 Sedona delivered confident power, making highway merging and hauling a full load feel manageable. Engine: 3.3-liter V6 Gasoline Direct Injection (GDI) engine. Horsepower: 276 hp @ 6,000 rpm Torque: 248 lb-ft @ 5,200 rpm Transmission: A major upgrade for 2019 was the replacement of the old 6-speed automatic with a new, smoother, and more efficient 8-speed automatic transmission. Drivetrain: Standard Front-Wheel Drive (FWD). The combination of the powerful V6 and the efficient 8-speed transmission resulted in a smooth, quiet, and capable driving experience that often felt more like an SUV than a traditional minivan. The EX Trim: Key Features and Upgrades The EX trim elevates the Sedona from a basic people-mover to a genuinely comfortable family hauler by adding several crucial convenience and premium features: Exterior: The EX trim includes Power Sliding Side Doors, which are essential for minivan convenience, and power-folding exterior mirrors. It also features 18-inch alloy wheels and front fog lights. Interior Comfort: Upgrades include leather seat trim (replacing cloth), heated front seats, an auto-dimming rearview mirror, and a push-button start with a smart key. Climate Control: The EX features Tri-Zone Automatic Climate Control, allowing the driver, front passenger, and rear passengers to set their own preferred temperatures. Technology: It includes a UV-reducing solar control glass and a standard 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with support for Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Interior Utility and Passenger Comfort Minivans are judged on practicality, and the Sedona offers a smart solution for cargo management. Seating Configuration: The EX model typically seats 8 passengers (2 front, 3 in the second row, 3 in the third row). An optional 7-passenger configuration with premium second-row Captain?s Chairs was also available. Slide-N-Stow: This unique feature allows the second-row seats to slide forward and up against the front seats, offering substantial cargo space without requiring the heavy seats to be physically removed from the vehicle. Cargo Volume: Behind the third row, the Sedona offers about 33.9 cubic feet of cargo room. With the third row stowed into the floor and the second row collapsed via Slide-N-Stow, the total cargo capacity expands to over 142 cubic feet. Design: The Sedona?s dashboard and cockpit were intentionally designed to feel more like an SUV than a typical van, with a high center console and clean, modern lines. Safety and Driver Assistance The 2019 Sedona EX came standard with a rearview camera and rear parking sensors. Additional safety features often included in packages were: Blind Spot Collision Warning (BCW) Rear Cross-Traffic Collision Warning (RCCW) Parking Distance Warning (PDW) www.ellectramotors.com @Ellectra_Motors Ellectra Motors 6600 Jurupa Ave, Ste 215D Riverside, CA 92504 Tel & Text: 951.900.1614 .

Stock Number 4433. \n \n\n One Owner! \n <b>OTHER NOTABLE FEATURES AND OPTIONS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT:</b>\n\n\n\n\n\nComfort<ul><li> Heated driver and front passenger seat cushions - That&#39;s hot. Heated driver and front passenger seat cushions provide more targeted warmth so you can get comfortable quicker in cold weather. If you have lower body pain, you might also be soothed by the heat while you drive. No matter the weather, find comfort in heated driver and front passenger seat cushions.</li></ul>Convenience<ul><li> Cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful, until cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed using the steering wheel mounted controls and it will maintain that speed without driver intervention. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.</li><li> Power open and close liftgate - On-demand access. When your arms are full of cargo, the last thing you want to do is set it all down just to open the liftgate, then pick it all back up to load it in. By remotely opening and closing, power liftgate lets you skip straight to the loading. It also eliminates the awkward stretch to reach up for the liftgate to close it. Load and go with power open and close liftgate.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Rear camera - Watching your back!

I purchased this SUV brand new March of 2023 for outings with my family. I don't have time to use it and the cost of storing it in a climate controlled garage is becoming cost prohibitive. This vehicle still has the new car smell. I have driving it maybe 10-15 times on short trips with my wife and son. Multiple tasteful upgrades add a great touch. Last year of the truly extraordinary bulletproof quality V8 GX SUV's. These Lexus GX SUV's equipped with the 4.6L V8 have gone down in history for being one of the most durable and long lasting vehicles on earth. You can no longer buy these brand new so if you missed your chance then this is the closest thing to new you will find on the market today. Financing available and trade ins are welcome. Extended warranties up to but not limited to 8 years and unlimited miles are available at attractive prices. Don't wait you will not find another GX as clean as this on the used car market anywhere!

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring</li><li> Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring</li><li> Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring</li><li> Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.

That&#39;s where Tom Tepe Autocenter in Milan, Indiana, and Car Country in Aurora, IN, and Harrison, OH come in with this stunning Carfax One-Owner 2023 Chevrolet Traverse High Country.<br /><br />This Traverse High Country is built for families who want minivan practicality without giving up premium style. The 3.6L V6 paired with a 9-speed automatic gives you smooth power for merging, passing, and highway cruising, even with the whole crew and cargo on board. With four-wheel independent suspension and 4-wheel disc brakes, it feels composed and confident on winding backroads or I-275 runs into the city.<br /><br />Inside is where this Traverse really spoils you. Perforated leather-appointed seating, heated and ventilated front seats, and heated 2nd-row outboard seats turn every commute into first-class travel. The 8-way power driver seat with lumbar, memory seat, and 6-way power front passenger seat let you dial in the perfect driving position and keep it saved, even if drivers rotate.<br /><br />Your crew will love the 3rd-row split-bench seating and easy access through the spacious second row. Add in rear air conditioning, multiple USBs, and smart storage, and you&#39;ve got a road-trip hero that makes long drives feel shorter. The Dual SkyScape power moonroof floods the cabin with light, giving everyone in all three rows a more open, airy feel on those drives across Southeast Indiana and into Northern Kentucky.<br /><br />Tech and sound are pure modern Chevy. The Chevrolet Infotainment 3 Plus system with navigation, Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, and a Bose Premium 10-speaker audio system keeps you connected, guided, and entertained.

Good Life Motors does not control what information is missing or incorrect on CARFAX, but we do look at the CARFAX to help inform us on a vehicle’s history. All financing is “on approved credit”. Price excludes tax, title, government fees, required dealer added accessories, and $499 dealer doc fee. We try to be 100% accurate in every detail, but sometimes we miff! We are sorry if we publish anything inaccurate and as soon as we are aware, we’ll do our best to correct any errors! We are always working hard to make your experience better and value your comments!
