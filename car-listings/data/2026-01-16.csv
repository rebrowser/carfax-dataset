This is a sedan built for real life â smooth, efficient, and quietly capable whether youâre carving through morning traffic on I-75 in Troy, cruising Woodward Avenue through Birmingham, or heading west on I-94 toward Ann Arbor. Under the hood, the turbocharged 1.5L EcoBoost engine pairs with a 6-speed automatic transmission to deliver responsive acceleration and confident efficiency. It feels composed merging near Telegraph Road in Dearborn and relaxed stretching out across Oakland County backroads. Auto Start-Stop technology keeps things efficient without interrupting the drive, making daily commuting feel effortless. Inside, the Fusion SE keeps everything clean and intuitive. Supportive cloth seating, a power driver seat, rotary gear selector, and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with mounted controls put everything exactly where you expect it. The power sunroof opens the cabin with natural light and fresh air, adding a sense of space whether youâre driving through Royal Oak or cruising quieter neighborhood streets. Dual-zone automatic climate control keeps comfort balanced year-round, while the split-folding rear seat adds flexibility for errands or weekend runs toward Washtenaw County. Technology works quietly in the background, exactly how it should. SYNCÂ infotainment with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto keeps navigation, calls, and music seamless, while Bluetooth connectivity and USB charging keep devices ready. A rearview camera and reverse sensing system simplify tight parking situations around downtown Detroit or busy lots near Somerset Collection. Safety is handled with confidence and clarity. Ford Co-Pilot360â features including Pre-Collision Assist with Automatic Emergency Braking, Lane-Keeping System, Blind Spot Information System, and Cross-Traffic Alert support you whether youâre navigating city streets in Wayne County or cruising south toward Toledo on US-23. From Michigan suburbs to Ohio highways and Indiana corridors like I-69 toward Fort Wayne, the Fusion SE delivers a calm, efficient, and intelligently equipped driving experience that fits real life without trying too hard.

Derrow Shirkey Ford&#39;s Wholesale Open to Public is a select offering of used cars that have traditionally been sold at the auction to independent dealers and small used car lots. These are vehicles that fall outside of Derrow Shirkey Ford&#39;s used car guidelines. They are generally higher mileage, older, lower-priced vehicles that are perhaps &#39;flawed&#39; in some way. Some general guidelines for a wholesale vehicle: • They are sold without a warranty • They are offered for a limited time only - 30 days • They are sold 100% AS-IS without any warranty coverage • They are sold with our &#34;best price&#34; posted on the windshield. There is no negotiation necessary. Why Wholesale Open to Public? Simply put - our customers have requested that we make these vehicles available. Many of our customers have a need for basic transportation. By offering a broader selection of &#34;kid&#39;s cars&#34;, 2nd car, college cars, and other inexpensive transportation options, we feel we can better serve our current customers and the general market.<br /><br />We are located 2 miles South of the turnpike at exit 13. Our location makes it a very simple drive from Toledo, Fort Wayne, Hillsdale, Angola, Bryan, Defiance, Napoleon, or Jackson. OUR MISSION STATEMENT- We will be honest and transparent. Through teamwork, honesty and hard work, we will build trusting relationships with our customers, always striving to exceed their expectations. The same holds true for our team members as we constantly learn and improve from within ourselves and each other. Come see for yourself why Derrow-Shirkey Ford Lincoln is the fastest growing dealership in the tri-state area. We are committed to making the car buying experience fast, fun and easy!!! 1. Pricing - We post our best price on every vehicle, every day. Period. 2. Trade In’s - We’ll make you a cash offer. No-Nonsense. We will buy your vehicle regardless if you purchase from us or not. 3.

Powered by a responsive V6 engine paired with an automatic transmission, it delivers smooth performance and enhanced traction in various road conditions. The Premier trim adds upscale touches including leather seating, a power-adjustable driver seat, automatic climate control, and premium interior accents. With a quiet cabin, composed ride quality, and solid safety features, the Milan offers a practical balance of comfort, performance, and year-round drivability. This vehicle has had two previous owners and was used exclusively as a personal vehicle, with the most recent ownership in Illinois. It benefits from an extensive maintenance record, showing 30 documented service history entries that indicate consistent care. The last reported odometer reading of 79,098 miles reflects relatively low mileage for its ownership history, further supporting confidence in the vehicle’s overall condition and responsible use.

This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane.
