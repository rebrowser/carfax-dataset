inline-6 (the B58 engine), producing about 335 hp and 330 lb-ft of torque plenty of power for day-to-day driving and highway passing.Quick acceleration:• 0-60 mph is around 5.3 seconds, which is brisk for a luxury SUV of this size.Excellent handling for an SUV:• BMWs xDrive all-wheel drive and balanced chassis deliver confident traction and agile handling in a wide range of conditions.All-Weather Capability & PracticalityStandard AWD:• xDrive (BMWs intelligent all-wheel drive) enhances grip and control in rain, snow, and uneven surfaces good for Tulsa winters or mountain trips.Optional Off-Road Gear:• Even though its primarily a road vehicle, available packages add Off-Road modes, air suspension, a locking differential, and skid plates for occasional off-pavement use.Comfort & Interior QualityPremium cabin materials:• Leather seating, soft-touch surfaces, and quality trim make the interior feel luxurious.Comfortable seating for families:• Generous space in front and rear, optional third row (best for kids) adds flexibility.Lots of comfort features:• Standard features often include heated front seats, panoramic sunroof, dual-zone climate control, and a power tailgate with higher option packages adding ventilated/massaging seats, ambient lighting, and more.Technology & SafetyModern tech suite:• iDrive infotainment, navigation, Apple CarPlay (wireless on some trims), and digital gauges are part of the package.Strong safety features:• Standard active safety tech includes blind-spot monitoring, lane-departure warning, forward collision warning, rear-cross-traffic alert, and automatic braking.Optional advanced driver assistance:• Adaptive cruise control with stop-and-go, lane-keeping assist, traffic jam assist, and self-parking features are available in upgraded packages.Real-World EfficiencyCompetitive fuel economy for its class:• The inline-6 typically returns low- to mid-20s mpg combined (EPA), and real-world highway tests sometimes exceed that decent for a luxury V6 SUV.Practical Ownership BenefitsGood value used:• As a 2019 model now on the used market, many buyers find that nicely optioned X5s offer luxury SUV capability at a more affordable price than a new one.Summary Why Its a Great ChoiceBalanced performance powerful yet smooth engine with solid handling.All-weather confidence standard AWD plus optional off-road tech.Luxury & comfort premium interior, plenty of features.Advanced tech & safety modern infotainment and driver aids.Good used value 2019 X5s can deliver high-end SUV experience for

We serve all the Oklahoma City metro including Oklahoma City, Edmond, Moore, Norman, and more. If you’re looking for a local car dealership that offers new INFINITIs, used vehicles of all makes and models, exceptional service, and multiple finance options we’ve got you covered. Looking for used vehicles for sale in Oklahoma City? At Bob Moore INFINITI we have a large assortment of used vehicles including a variety of makes and models. While we carry many used makes and models, we also carry used INFINITIs in case you aren’t looking for new models. If you’re still trying to decide which model and trim is the best fit, we can get you with one of our certified INFINITI specialists to go over all the details — whether it’s regarding features, warranties, service, financing, or any other areas you’d like addressed. Our dealership also offers a variety of amenities, free Wi-Fi, and all kinds of perks. For those wishing to shop for their car online, we can help you with that as well. All our inventory is held on our website where you can complete the whole purchase process. If you’d like to visit the dealership but need assistance getting there, we offer free valet service within 30 minutes of our store and give free at-home delivery. If you need to schedule any of these services, please call our dealership.<br />When buying an used vehicle, we want to make sure you get your money’s worth. To ensure this, we put all our used vehicles through a service reconditioning process. This process includes a 106-point inspection of the vehicle to ensure that it’s up to our standards. We make sure the tires have three 30-second tire depths or 30%, if they don’t, we’ll replace the tires. We’ll also replace any brakes over 3mm. After the vehicles full inspection, it leaves the shop and goes through cosmetic refurbishing where we inspect and replace scratches, dents, scuffs, and road rash, as well as interior leather and upholstery reconditioning. While we work hard to ensure the quality of all used vehicles, we must acknowledge that some will end up with defects. Speak with one of our sales specialists about an used vehicle you’re interested in to get a history of the car. Bob Moore also covers all your INFINITI, and any other make or model, service needs with our factory trained technicians, including 4 master certified technicians. This includes a complimentary car wash and vacuum with every service. Prior to your service, contact our dealership team to get your service appointment set up. Financing a vehicle purchase can be a stressful process but Bob Moore INFINITI offers a seamless auto financing, with over 20 lenders to work with. This helps us ensure that we’re getting you the best deal possible for your new car. If you have any questions when going through the financing, don’t stress. We’ll have our INFINITI finance expert there with you to answer any questions or concerns you might have. Do you need to trade in your current vehicle? We buy cars too. Whether it’s a trade-in for a new purchase or just simply selling your vehicle, we’d love to work with you.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",158.2,

Better Fuel EconomyThe RWD version typically edges out the AWD variant in efficiency. According to EPA estimates, the GLC300 RWD is rated around 22 city / 28 highway mpg, slightly better than the AWD version.3. Lower Purchase Price & Ownership CostRWD is the base drivetrain for 2019 GLC300, so its MSRP is usually lower than GLC300 4MATIC AWD. This can mean lower upfront cost and potentially lower insurance costs vs AWD.Simpler drivetrain (no AWD hardware) means fewer components that could require maintenance or repair over time.4. Adequate Power & Smooth AutoPowered by a 241-hp 2.0 L turbo four-cylinder with a 9-speed automatic, the GLC300 has confident acceleration for everyday driving.Rear-wheel drive can make the most of that power in dry conditions, offering smooth launches and predictable throttle behavior.5. Comfortable Ride & Luxury CabinThe GLC300 delivers a comfortable and well-damped ride, with quality interior materials and a premium feel expected of Mercedes-Benz.Standard features include a supportive drivers seat, refined cabin design, and a user-friendly infotainment interface.6. Drive Mode FlexibilityThe DYNAMIC SELECT system (with ECO, Comfort, Sport, Sport+, and Individual modes) lets you tailor throttle response, transmission shifts, and steering feel. This makes the GLC300 RWD feel versatile from relaxed cruising to a livelier drive.7. Weight AdvantageWithout AWD hardware, the RWD variant is generally lighter. Lower weight can improve acceleration, braking, and help marginally with efficiency and handling balance.Every used vehicle on our lot goes through a strenuous, multi-point inspection before its ever offered for sale because quality and safety aren't just priorities for us, they're part of our heritage.

With touchscreen, your fingerprints will be all over your drive.</li></ul>Powertrain and Mechanical<ul><li> All wheel drive - all weather drive.

So get a firm grip on the road, better acceleration and added peace of mind in poor weather conditions with all-wheel drive.</li><li> Variable valve timing - Change your output. There are a lot of variables in your drive, so why should your engine always operate the same? With variable valve timing, the engine is efficient at both low and high RPM&#39;s, so you get better fuel efficiency, cleaner emissions and improved performance. Variable valve timing provides a better drive, every time.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Rear collision mitigation - It has your back. Rear collision mitigation uses sensors to monitor the area behind you. If it senses an impending crash, it activates certain features to help prevent a collision or reduce the severity of it. Put your worries behind you with rear collision mitigation.</li><li> Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane. Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.</li><li> Active blind spot system - Protect your blind side. You checked the mirror, looked over your shoulder and still nearly collided with the car next to you. An active blind spot system not only alerts you to the presence of a vehicle to your sides or rear but helps prevent you from making an unsafe lane change. Replace fear and uncertainty with the confidence and safety of the Active blind spot system.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li><li> Selective Internet access - a more focused delivery. Selective internet access allows you to tailor the features for your feed, such as sports scores, local news, or current weather. When it comes to getting what you want, selective internet access is a net gain.</li></ul>\n\n\n While reasonable efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy of vehicle descriptions, dealer is not responsible for errors or omission regarding specific equipment, features, packages or details.

PREMIUM FACTORY ALLOY WHEELS!! TOW PACKAGE!! A REALLY NICE PATHFINDER!! Goldie's Motors has implemented a new transparent and aggressive pricing structure. To be competitive and give our customers the best possible value. We are pricing select vehicles at or below our cost. We only charge a $385.00 doc fee plus an additional $1,000 on top of the sale price, which is the majority of our total profit on the car. Our fees will include a complete vehicle inspection, window tinting, floor mats, and a complete detail. There are absolutely no hidden costs or miscellaneous fees. Our total vehicle costs will be hard to beat! In addition, we will not sacrifice the quality of our vehicles and continue to go through each car thoroughly. We aim to increase our volume and offer our customers the best possible experience. We are a family-owned store. Both of our owners (brothers) are based in Arizona. The store is staffed with residents, veterans, and retirees, and we all contribute to the success of our community. Our kids go to the local schools, we donate to local charities, and we volunteer throughout our communities. We would appreciate the opportunity to earn your business. We just got this sharp and very well-cared-for upgraded Pathfinder from a very trusted national lender. The last owner took really nice care of this Nissan. It has a fantastic 58,281 miles, that is only an average of 8,325 miles driven per year!! When we purchased this Pathfinder it was announced as structural alteration due to the towing package. It is really nice!! The very sharp and upgraded magnetic black exterior paint looks great and is in excellent condition especially for its year and the miles. The equally sharp premium interior is equally nice and has been well-maintained, there is no sign it has been smoked in. This is very well equipped with all the options listed above, plus a long, long list of factory upgrades that make it a very, very nice upgraded luxury and high performance suv that looks and drives great — and the overall condition reflects how well it’s been cared for. In addition it has just been fully serviced by our Nissan specialist, including a comprehensive multi-point pre-owned vehicle inspection, and everything checked out in excellent condition. Since this is a Carfax-certified vehicle with an excellent service history and a fully completed pre-owned inspection, it qualifies for several certified pre-owned (CPO) extended warranty options at reduced rates. Our family environment and great pricing not only make Goldie’s Motors one of the most comfortable places to buy a car, but it also makes us one of the FASTEST. You can drive out of our dealership in less than an hour after selecting your future car! WE ARE OPEN 6 DAYS A WEEK. Please visit us Monday-Friday, 8:30 am-6 pm, and Saturday, 8:30 am-4 pm, or call to schedule an appointment at our all-new Sales and Service center in Mesa, Arizona.

It’s built for families, towing, and long-distance drives, offering strong capability and premium amenities that justify its flagship status. Performance & Capability Engine & Transmission: At its heart is a 3.5-liter EcoBoost® twin-turbo V6 engine, producing strong power and torque suited for hauling passengers and trailers alike. This engine is paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission that includes manual shift capability for more control when needed. Towing & Driving: The Platinum trim benefits from robust capability, including an available four-wheel drive and adaptive suspension options that enhance ride comfort and handling. Maximum towing capacity approaches 9,200 pounds when properly equipped — making it practical for boats, campers, and heavy loads. Exterior Highlights Bold Full-Size SUV Presence: The Platinum wears a commanding road presence with large body proportions, chrome exterior accents, and standard 22-inch polished aluminum wheels that distinguish it from lower trims. Premium Lighting & Glass: Features like LED lighting, privacy glass, and available rain-sensing wipers add convenience and aesthetic appeal. Sunroof & Roof Features: A power sunroof or panoramic glass roof is commonly included, letting light into the cabin and adding to the upscale touch. Interior Comfort & Design Seating & Space: The Platinum is designed to seat up to eight passengers with generous headroom and legroom for all three rows. Premium leather upholstery and luxury seating surfaces enhance comfort, while heated and power-adjustable front seats come standard. Materials & Ambience: Expect high-quality interior materials with woodgrain or accent trim, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, and thoughtful touches throughout the cabin that project refinement suited to its flagship status. Cargo & Versatility: Third-row seating can fold down to expand cargo space, and power-folding third-row options make reconfiguring the interior easier for gear or luggage. Technology & Connectivity Infotainment: The Platinum trim typically includes Ford’s SYNC® 3 infotainment system with an 8-inch touchscreen, voice-activated navigation, and seamless integration for Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™. Audio Excellence: A premium Sony® audio system with 12 speakers and subwoofer brings an immersive listening experience to long journeys. Convenience Features: Standard tech features often include push-button start, multiple USB/12V outlets, rear entertainment options, Bluetooth® connectivity, and hands-free phone integration.

Heated driver and front passenger seat cushions provide more targeted warmth so you can get comfortable quicker in cold weather. If you have lower body pain, you might also be soothed by the heat while you drive. No matter the weather, find comfort in heated driver and front passenger seat cushions.</li></ul>Convenience<ul><li> Cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful, until cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed using the steering wheel mounted controls and it will maintain that speed without driver intervention. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.</li><li> Power open and close liftgate - On-demand access. When your arms are full of cargo, the last thing you want to do is set it all down just to open the liftgate, then pick it all back up to load it in. By remotely opening and closing, power liftgate lets you skip straight to the loading. It also eliminates the awkward stretch to reach up for the liftgate to close it. Load and go with power open and close liftgate.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power.

This Chevrolet Tahoe offers all the comforts of a well-optioned sedan with the utility you demand from an SUV. Is it possible to fall in love with a vehicle? It is when your vehicle is as prestige as the Chevrolet Tahoe. Look no further, you have found exactly what you&#39;ve been looking for. More information about the 2017 Chevrolet Tahoe: The Suburban and Tahoe are by far the best-selling models in their class, and they&#39;re tough rivals for the Ford Expedition, Toyota Sequoia and Nissan Armada, among others. These two Chevy models are closely related in most ways--although there&#39;s a key difference: the Suburban is 14 inches longer in wheelbase and 20 inches longer overall than the Tahoe, and that results in a significantly larger third-row seat than in the Tahoe--as well as easier access to it, and more cargo space. Compared to rival models, the Chevy Tahoe and Suburban stand out for their ride quality and relatively efficient engines. They&#39;re also very rugged and versatile, and can be outfitted for off-road toughness, tow ability and interior luxury as needed. Chevrolet claims that the Suburban will be the most fuel-efficient model in the full-size SUV class, thanks to tech such as direct injection and active fuel management (cylinder deactivation). Although the profile of the Suburban and Tahoe haven&#39;t changed all that much, Chevy has managed to make significant improvements to aerodynamics. Chiseled sheet metal and big, flamboyant wheels (up to 22 inches) help maintain a powerful look. This model sets itself apart with Much-improved interior, seating space, towing ability, versatility and toughness, comfortable, refined ride, and relatively fuel-efficient engines<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",143.7,

While we carry many used makes and models, we also carry used INFINITIs in case you aren’t looking for new models. If you’re still trying to decide which model and trim is the best fit, we can get you with one of our certified INFINITI specialists to go over all the details — whether it’s regarding features, warranties, service, financing, or any other areas you’d like addressed. Our dealership also offers a variety of amenities, free Wi-Fi, and all kinds of perks. For those wishing to shop for their car online, we can help you with that as well.

If you need to schedule any of these services, please call our dealership.<br />When buying an used vehicle, we want to make sure you get your money’s worth. To ensure this, we put all our used vehicles through a service reconditioning process. This process includes a 106-point inspection of the vehicle to ensure that it’s up to our standards. We make sure the tires have three 30-second tire depths or 30%, if they don’t, we’ll replace the tires. We’ll also replace any brakes over 3mm. After the vehicles full inspection, it leaves the shop and goes through cosmetic refurbishing where we inspect and replace scratches, dents, scuffs, and road rash, as well as interior leather and upholstery reconditioning. While we work hard to ensure the quality of all used vehicles, we must acknowledge that some will end up with defects. Speak with one of our sales specialists about an used vehicle you’re interested in to get a history of the car. Bob Moore also covers all your INFINITI, and any other make or model, service needs with our factory trained technicians, including 4 master certified technicians.

Stock Number 66506A. You can connect \nwith us by calling 781-246-3331.\n \n\n\nNo Accidents! One Owner! \n <b>OTHER NOTABLE FEATURES AND OPTIONS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT:</b>\n\nBase Model<ul></ul>\n\n\n\nConvenience<ul><li> Cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful, until cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed using the steering wheel mounted controls and it will maintain that speed without driver intervention. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.</li><li> Power open and close liftgate - On-demand access. When your arms are full of cargo, the last thing you want to do is set it all down just to open the liftgate, then pick it all back up to load it in. By remotely opening and closing, power liftgate lets you skip straight to the loading. It also eliminates the awkward stretch to reach up for the liftgate to close it. Load and go with power open and close liftgate.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Selective Internet access - a more focused delivery. Selective internet access allows you to tailor the features for your feed, such as sports scores, local news, or current weather. When it comes to getting what you want, selective internet access is a net gain.</li></ul>\n\nBASE MODEL, DARK GRAY METALLIC, GRAY, PERFORATED LEATHER-TRIMMED UPHOLSTERY \n At Albrecht Subaru of Wakefield, we&#39;re here to <b>Serve you!</b> Our staff is 100% dedicated to customer satisfaction and we understand that you need clear, transparent information throughout the car buying process.

HARD TO FIND!!! ONLY 73,500 MILES!!! LOADED!!! NAVIGATION!!! LEATHER SEATS!!! HEATED AND POWER SEATS!!! POWER THIRD ROW SEATING!!! AND MORE!!! PLEASE HURRY!!! PRICED TO SELL!!!.Unlike other models dubbed ""Sport,"" the 2017 Explorer Sport is indeed sporty, thanks to its turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 with 290HP, stiffer suspension tuning, quicker steering and our test vehicle's optional summer performance tires. The result is lots of speed and impressive handling and braking.The Explorer drives bigger than it is. Its well-damped ride prioritizes comfort over dynamic handling a blessing on rough roads or long road trips, but a curse for those who enjoy taking a winding route home. The Explorer's ride-and-handling balance toes the line expected of players in this class, and its body control in corners is par for the segment.While the materials used in our top-of-the-line Platinum test vehicle were of high quality, cabin fit and finish were horrid panels fit together poorly, and gaps were large. Spacious accommodations, comfortable front seats, and solid ergonomics are the interiors few saving graces. As in the front row, second-row passengers are treated to impressive amounts of legroom and headroom.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",161,
