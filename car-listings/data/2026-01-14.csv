Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful, until cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed using the steering wheel mounted controls and it will maintain that speed without driver intervention. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li></ul>\n\nWheels: 18\&#39; x 7.5\&#39; Aluminum-Alloy, Express Open/Close Sliding And Tilting Glass 1st Row Sunroof w/Sunshade, Perimeter/Approach Lights, 3 LCD Monitors In The Front, Smart Device Integration, Perimeter Alarm, Predictive Forward Collision Warning w/FEB, Collision Mitigation-Front\n At Holler Honda, all of our vehicles are clearly marked with our haggle-free best price and our sales associates are commission-free.

Now, with Distance pacing cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and the vehicle ahead. Distance pacing cruise control, your ultimate co-pilot.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them.

Check out the following:\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nSafety and Security<ul><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li><li> Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane. Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.</li><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li></ul>\nAuto On/Off Projector Beam Led Low Beam Daytime Running Auto High-Beam Headlamps w/Delay-Off, Perimeter/Approach Lights, Cruise Control w/Steering Wheel Controls, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low-Speed Follow\n We price our cars, not our Customers.

Maybe you fell asleep. Maybe you lost consciousness. No matter how it happens, Unresponsive driver assistant works to help lessen the danger when it does. It detects prolonged driver unresponsiveness, automatically bringing the vehicle to a stop and turning on the hazard lights. If equipped, emergency services will also be contacted. Unresponsive driver assistant is safety that never sleeps.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them.

We want every customer&#39;s experience to be as timely, comfortable and ultimately as satisfying as it possible can be. You&#39;ll see it in every department of every Napleton Auto Group dealership. We hope you&#39;ll join the thousands of other satisfied customers that buy and service their vehicles the Napleton way.\n\n<b>No Accidents! </b>\n<b>One Owner! </b>\n \nThis 2025 Hyundai Elantra SE offered in Intense Blue will make a great addition to your family or business!\n\nBe sure to take note of all this vehicle has to offer:\n\nOption Group 01<ul></ul>\nConvenience<ul><li> Cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful, until cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed using the steering wheel mounted controls and it will maintain that speed without driver intervention. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Apple CarPlay &amp; Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring</li></ul>\n\nOther notable features:\n\n\n\n <b>Napleton Downtown Chevrolet Buick GMC</b> is proud to serve customers in communities throughout the Chicagoland area.

Maybe you fell asleep. Maybe you lost consciousness. No matter how it happens, Unresponsive driver assistant works to help lessen the danger when it does. It detects prolonged driver unresponsiveness, automatically bringing the vehicle to a stop and turning on the hazard lights. If equipped, emergency services will also be contacted. Unresponsive driver assistant is safety that never sleeps.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Wireless App-Connect (w/Apple CarPlay, Android Auto &amp; MirrorLink) smart device wireless mirroring</li></ul>\n\t\t\tPYRITE SILVER METALLIC, GRIGIO/TITAN BLACK, CLOUDTEX &amp; V-TEX LEATHERETTE SEAT TRIM \n\nCome on in to <b>Bill Jacobs Volkswagen</b> today at <b>2211 Aurora Ave Naperville IL 60540</b> or call <b>844-746-7928</b> to schedule a test drive!","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",158,

At Dobbs Brothers, we are taking the Mid-South Back to Better. We are the fourth generation of the Dobbs family, and we have remained the most trusted name in the automotive business since 1921 by honoring our word and our advertised prices. Unlike many big-box dealers in Memphis and the surrounding Tri-State area, we do not charge for pre-loaded addendums like nitrogen in tires or forced paint and fabric protection. We believe in honoring our prices without playing games or adding things you never asked for to the sales price. This 2025 Nissan Sentra SV is the most loaded example we have ever seen, offering a &#34;near-new&#34; experience with just 6,829 miles.<br /><br />Technically, the 2025 Sentra SV is powered by a 2.0L Direct Injection Gasoline (DIG) 4-cylinder engine, providing a spirited 149 horsepower while maintaining an incredible EPA-estimated 40 MPG on the highway—perfect for the I-240 commute. This specific unit is a technical marvel in its segment, featuring the SV Premium Package. This includes the power-sliding glass Sunroof, a 360-degree Intelligent Around View Monitor, and the stunning Tan Leather seats with Diamond Stitching. The interior is further enhanced by an 8-inch color touchscreen display with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Safety is standard with Nissan Safety Shield 360, providing a suite of 6 advanced features including Automatic Emergency Braking with Pedestrian Detection and Blind Spot Warning.<br /><br />Our aim is simple: we want to be the best place in the Mid-South to buy a vehicle, service a vehicle, and work. By removing the pressure of unnecessary pre-loaded addendums, we allow the incredible engineering and premium luxury of this Sentra to speak for itself. When you shop at Dobbs Brothers, you are dealing with a local family that has been a pillar of the community for over a century. Experience a transparent process that respects your time and your intelligence. It’s time to go Back to Better with the fourth generation of the Dobbs family.<br />Rediscover the name Memphis has trusted for over 100 years at the all-new, locally owned and operated Dobbs Brothers Chevrolet. With no-nonsense pricing, no games, and no gimmicks, we aim to provide an experience so great that you won&#39;t ever want to buy a vehicle from anyone else.

One Owner! \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Corolla has the following features:\nSafety and Security<ul><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li></ul>\n\n\n At Holler Honda, all of our vehicles are clearly marked with our haggle-free best price and our sales associates are commission-free.

More information about the 2017 Mercedes-Benz E-Class: The Mercedes Benz E-Class is a mid-sized luxury car, in competition with Audi's A6 sedan, BMW's 5-Series and the Lexus GS. All offer plenty of space, with an array of powerful engines, but none offer the kind of refinement and ease of operation that the new E-Class has. The E-Class also offers great fuel economy for a luxury vehicle, making due (in E300 guise) with a turbocharged 4-cylinder while most of its competitors use bigger and thirstier engines. While the engine in the E300 is small, thanks to turbocharging and an advanced transmission, acceleration remains competitive. This model sets itself apart with powerful, but fuel efficient engine, semi-autonomous driver assist systems, Luxurious ride, available all-wheel drive, technology laden features, and spacious interior Burmester is a registered trademark of Burmester Audiosysteme GmbH, Berlin, Germany.

First Time, Every Time!<br />Our sales people understand that buying a new or used vehicle can be a stressful experience. After all, statistics show that, after a home, an automobile is the biggest investment most of us will ever make. And, with most car dealers you are forced to enter a haggling/negotiating game to TRY to get the best deal possible.<br /><br />It&#39;s just too much!!<br />But that is not the case at Quality Toyota. Our commitment to Bottom Line Pricing means that you get Our Best Price the first time, every time. You get our best price even before you talk to a sales person because Our Best Price is posted in the window of every vehicle on our lot.<br /><br />The No Hassle/No Haggle Way to Buy a Car, SUV, or Truck<br />The fact that it is unnecessary to spend a great deal of time negotiating means that our salespeople can place emphasis where it belongs, finding the best possible vehicle for you, based on your needs and budget. After we find that vehicle (which will already have Our Best Price), we can focus on ensuring that you are completely satisfied with your purchase. Our goal is to make the car buying experience as pleasant and stress-free as possible.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",124.25,
