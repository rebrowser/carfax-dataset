Give us a call or send us a text at 435-752-7424!<br />BRANDED TITLES: We sell rebuilt/restored vehicles because they offer superior value for our clients. All of our branded cars go through very rigorous and thorough testing. We oversee the build process to ensure our standards are met. We will NEVER sell a car that we feel has been structurally compromised or unsafe in any way. This means NO cut corners, NO safety issues. All branded cars go through 3 sets of eyes to ensure the best cars are being sold. A 3 month bumper to bumper warranty free-of-charge is included with the purchase of a rebuilt title. Ask us what was repaired on them! BUY BRANDED to save thousands on your next car -- and get a better bang for your buck. We believe there is NO better value than a Rich&#39;s R/R title vehicle.<br />OUR WARRANTY: ‘Bumper to bumper‘ coverage for 3 months/3,000 miles is offered for all branded titles and cars under 100k miles. This covers any mechanical malfunction with the car following the purchase, with $0 deductible. We guarantee our cars because we trust them. We offer this same warranty coverage for up to 5 years at an additional cost. Our extended warranties are NOT 3rd party warranties, so there is no run-around in getting repairs covered (no 1-800 numbers, paperwork, etc). It is a no-hassle service offered for the convenience of our customers. <br />FINANCING: With a seasoned team of finance professionals, we have the knowledge and experience to get you the very best rate for your credit experience.

Please use the listed price as the most up to date price. This vehicle has a notation on the Carfax that it was reacquired by the manufacturer. Simply put, the customer had a complaint about the vehicle and asked the manufacturer to take the car back. As a result, the trade value or selling price you will get for this vehicle is likely to be lower than for a similar vehicle that was not reacquired. This is reflected in the price you are paying for the vehicle now and why the vehicle is less expensive than a similar one that was not reacquired. In time, the difference in value between this vehicle and a normal vehicle will shrink. Therefore, if you plan to keep the vehicle for an extended period of time you will likely capture more of the savings of the lower price than if you sell or trade the vehicle within a short period after purchasing it. Sophisticated, smart, and stylish, this 2024 Chevrolet Silverado 2500HD is a meticulous collaboration between pleasantness and polish.

Note that this program can also apply to vehicles where the remaining factory coverage is less than 6 months or 6,000 miles. Please check the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Buyers guide on the vehicle for full details as to whether or not warranty coverage may apply. Contact Dealer for additional details. The Wyler Assurance 6 month/6,000 Mile limited warranty ends 6 months from the date of the Retail Purchase Agreement (BUYERS ORDER) or when the vehicle's odometer registers 6,000 additional miles to the mileage listed on the BUYERS ORDER, whichever comes first.

As the brand&#39;s first production PHEV, the SF90 Stradale combines electrification with traditional Ferrari soul, creating an experience that is technologically advanced yet still emotionally intoxicating. Under the rear glass sits a 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8, paired with three electric motors for a combined output of 986 horsepower. Power is sent to all four wheels through an 8-speed dual-clutch transmission, making the SF90 the first Ferrari plug-in hybrid with AWD. The result? A blistering 0-60 mph in just 2.5 seconds and handling precision that pushes the limits of what a road car can do. Rather than a rear spoiler that raises above certain speeds, the SF90 activates its active aero features by dropping a wedge-shaped panel to reveal a Gurney flap spoiler––a fast-acting system that generates as much as 860 pounds of downforce. Behind the wheel, the cabin wraps the driver in Nero/Giallo Leather, with the signature manettino steering wheel and carbon fiber trim reminding you of its performance intentions. The integration of digital displays with classic analog cues ensures a driving experience that is both modern and timeless. Every switch, paddle, and display is positioned toward the driver for maximum engagement, while your plus one gets a Passenger Display to enjoy the thrill.<br /><br />OPTIONAL EQUIPMENT<br />Blu Tour De France<br />Nero Leather <br />Giallo Stitching<br />Full Electric Seats<br />Diamond-Polished Forged Wheels<br />Titanium Wheel Stud Bolts<br />Black Contrast Roof<br />Black Tailpipe Tips<br />Carbon Ceramic Brakes w/Yellow Calipers<br />Carbon Fiber Driver Zone w/LEDs<br />Carbon Fiber Dash Inserts<br />Suspension Lifter<br />Apple CarPlay<br />Front &amp; Rear Parking Sensors<br /><br />GENERAL<br />Year: 2023<br />Mileage: 251<br />VIN #: ZFF95NLA5P0293271<br />Engine Size: 4.0L V8 (Twin-Turbo/Plug-In Hybrid) <br />Class: Coupe<br />Horsepower: 986<br />Color: Blu Tour De France<br />Interior: Nero Leather <br />Fuel: Premium Unleaded Gasoline<br />Gear Box: 8-Speed Dual-Clutch Automatic<br />Doors: 2<br />Seats: 2<br />Cylinders: 8<br /><br />SAFETY EQUIPMENT<br />Dual Stage Driver and Passenger Airbags<br />Electronic Traction Control<br />Dynamic Stability Control<br />Roll Stability Control<br />Anti-Lock Braking System<br />Driver Condition Response<br />Driver Monitoring Alert<br />Tire Specific Low Tire Pressure Warning<br />Front &amp; Rear Parking Sensors<br /><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />1 Key Included<br />Balance of Factory Warranty (if applicable)<br />Extended Warranties Available","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",132.7,

Don't miss your chance to own a piece of automotive history that's both stunning and eco-friendly. This classic beauty won't last long, so schedule a test drive and experience the future of vintage automobiles!ECD's fully custom builds move through 20 different assembly stations, for a total investment of around 2,200 hours of labor. Tesla-fying a vintage Rover is done in such a way as to preserve as much of the original structure and driving dynamics as possible. So the Tesla motor and direct drive unit are turned 90 degrees and mounted about where the old transfer case went. So instead of powering the left and right rear wheels of a Model S, the Tesla bits power the two offset driveshafts that spin the original live axles with a straight-up 50/50 torque split (and no low range). To withstand the Tesla motor's 450 hp and 325 lb-ft of torque, the SUV's original axles are upgraded with GBR Utah limited-slip differentials, Ashcroft half-shafts, and reinforced driveshafts from Tom Woods/Quadratec. Tesla battery modules are repackaged in two boxes, a big one that goes in the engine compartment and a smaller one that mounts inside the cargo area, the battery cooling system rides beneath the rear of the chassis. Together, these battery modules amount to 110 kWh of capacity. Charging is via a standard CCS Level 2 charging plug located behind the fuel-filler door. Sorry, there's no Tesla Supercharging or DC fast charging. This drivetrain swap adds about 1,400 pounds (6,400 total), much of it in the rear, so to bolster the GVW rating and achieve the proper ride height and body attitude, ECD puts the old Range Rover on air springs. Other chassis modifications include a switch to rear brake calipers that incorporate an electric parking brake—a major upgrade over the rear-driveshaft-mounted drum brake—and, to clear the front battery box, replacing the original hydraulic steering unit with one from a P38 Range Rover (1994-2001) that's powered by an electric pump.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",125.75,"Accident reported"

Come take this beauty for a test drive today! Land Rover supplied the Defender 90 NAS to North America for just three years, (1994, 1995 and 1997) in very low volumes. This example is number 2,413 produced and is powered by the venerable 3.9L naturally aspirated V8 engine sourced from the Rover Group and paired it with the 5-speed R-380 manual transmission. Initially, the Defender 90 was only available as a soft-top with a structural roll cage, but a later version was offered with a unique, removable, fiber-glass roof...this example is one which was supplied with this removable hardtop roof, (whilst still retaining the structural roll cage).This stunning example underwent a complete and professional restoration prior to our purchase in early-2021 to a very high level of attention to detail throughout. Almost everything has been replaced or refinished, including new paint and a new drive train, which includes a 3.9-liter 8-cylinder replacement factory engine, rebuilt original heads, new 5-speed manual transmission and a new transfer case. The radiator has been re-cored with an air conditioning system overhaul, including new hoses, compressor, condenser and blower. Custom thermal wrap covers the new intake hose and thermal sleeves cover the spark plugs. The new suspension includes 2-inch Terrafirma shocks, springs, steering stabilizer, BFGoodrich AT tires and new steel braided brake lines. The under body has been sprayed, headers and exhaust system have been painted, and the differentials, suspension and brake components refinished. The engine compartment has been customized with premium loom covering all wires and hoses, hood insulation pad and a custom polished radiator overflow reservoir. The interior has been redone to present as new and includes Dynamat insulation, new Exmoor Trim carpeting and mats, Land Rover rubber floor mats, Rovers North door panels and new shift boots. All gauges, knobs, steering column switches, rearview mirror, various pieces of dash (dash top, lower dash finishing trim) have also been replaced with new components and the dash recess was repainted. The original cubby was replaced with a larger, lockable metal cubby. The exterior features many custom details. Flat black textured paint has been applied to the roll bar, brush bar, running boards, fender flares, metal plate body protection, headlight surrounds and LED running light/turn signal bases.

More information about the 2017 Buick Cascada: There aren&#39;t many options these days when it comes to compact premium convertibles, but Buick is looking to change that. The Cascada is a lovely, stylish rag top that comes loaded with all the stuff buyers want that would cost $3,500 more to get in the Audi A3 cabriolet. The Cascada outshines the BMW 228i convertible as well, easily besting it for standard features. With room for four adults to cruise top down in comfort, and with more trunk space than either the Mustang or Camaro convertible, the Cascada is a fascinating -- and potentially popular proposition from Buick. Strengths of this model include fast-opening convertible top, standard technology, well-appointed interior, and Attractive, muscular styling<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",121.65,

The most recently service was completed by Ferrari of Fort Lauderdale in August 2025. The warranty start date was December 14th, 2022. Unveiled in June 2021, the 296 is Ferrari's first regular production model with a six-cylinder hybrid drive train that can produce a total of 819hp at 8,000rpm. The 2,992cc twin-turbo V6 engine is responsible for a total of 654hp with the electric only motor providing an additional 165hp. Torque is rated at 546lb/ft from the combined ICE and electric motors. A high-voltage accumulator positioned under the floor with an energy capacity of 7.45 kWh enables an electric only range of 16 miles. 0 to 62 mph (100km/h) is accomplished in just 2.9 seconds with a top speed recorded as being 205 mph.The 296 GTB replaced the prior mid-engine Ferrari F8 and joins the limited production SF90 in introducing a hybrid gas and electric joint power train.This beautiful example is finished in Grigio Scuro with Giallo Modena contrasting accents over a Nero Black interior and is optioned with almost $170,000 in optional extras. For a full breakdown of these optional items, the original window sticker is on display and is accompanied by the build plaque in the front trunk area.The Assetto Fiorano specification includes the following GT racing-derived upgrades:- Multimac shock absorbers optimized for the track.- High downforce carbon fiber appendages on the front bumper.- A lightweight Lexan rear screen.- Extensive lightweight carbon fiber materials both inside and out.More than just replacing elements of the 296 GTB, the Assetto Fiorano package completely redesigns some core aspects of the model, including a redesigned door panel (shedding over 26lbs) and a LaFerrari inspired active rear bumper designed to increase downforce by as much as 793lbs.Supplied with this 296 GTB are both keys, owners handbook package and the original window sticker.At Galpin Jaguar Land Rover of Van Nuys, our commitment to our customers produces one of the most valuable assets – and that's trust!

Its a 1-owner SUV with a good service history, and its been mainly serviced at Toyota dealerships, which is exactly what you want to see when youre shopping for a clean, dependable RAV4.<br /><br />The best part, it has about 25,000 fewer miles than the average vehicle on the market within 500 miles, so youre getting the same proven Toyota reliability with a lot less wear and tear. Add in All-Wheel Drive and youve got a RAV4 that&#39;s ready for any weather, road trips, and everything in between without the drama.<br /><br />Inside, you&#39;ll love the comfort and convenience features like dual-zone climate control, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, Bluetooth, USB port, and the smart key system. The fold-flat 2nd row seats make it easy to switch from passenger duty to cargo duty in seconds, whether you&#39;re hauling groceries, sports gear, or a suspicious amount of home improvement supplies.<br /><br />For safety and confidence on the road, this RAV4 XLE comes with lane departure warning, blind spot monitor, rear cross traffic alert, and a backup camera. It also has a power tilt/slide moonroof for those days when you want fresh air without committing to a convertible lifestyle.<br /><br />You&#39;ll also get navigation and SiriusXM, so you can find your way anywhere while listening to something better than road noise and regret.<br /><br />And when you buy from us, you&#39;re part of something bigger: through our Keys 2 Empower program, after we sell 100 cars, we donate a vehicle to someone in need. So yes, you&#39;re getting a great SUV, and you&#39;re helping someone else get a fresh start too.<br /><br />All of our cars receive a 172 point inspection*, a full professional detail, fresh oil, new cabin and engine air filters, two keys** when available, and a full tank of fuel so you start off strong.<br /><br />At Mike&#39;s Car Store you get an easy buying experience with Chevy Dude, a well known YouTuber and the #1 car buying advocate online. His channel is packed with tips that help you beat the dealer and buy smarter. Buying A Car Doesn&#39;t Have To Suck, so check out our no haggle pricing. For availability or questions, call 812-940-6453. We are in Georgetown Indiana, about 15 minutes from Louisville.<br /><br />We collect a 199.50 document fee on every sale. No surprise fees. Buyers are responsible for shipping, tax, tag, title, and license.<br /><br />Philanthropy: For every 100 cars sold we donate a vehicle to someone who needs transportation. We also cover their taxes and title fees so they start with a clean slate.<br /><br />We work hard to present accurate info, although listings might not show every feature. Inventory is subject to prior sale. Some photos are examples or stock photos. Vehicles might be off site or in transit. See the dealer for full details.

This vehicle is available for viewing in our Tampa Showroom by appointment only. Please call us to schedule an appointment. This fun clean little 2-seater drop top is a thrill to drive and has super low mileage. 12,628 actual miles on the clock and meticulously maintained, it has a lot of life to give. With a clean Carfax and 2-owner history, there is nothing to be afraid of with this little Chrysler sports car! This 2005 Chrysler Crossfire is a fuel-efficient sports car with plenty of pep and a long list of options. It is sure to please any car enthusiast. The 3.2-liter V6 engine puts down 215 horsepower with 229 lb-ft of torque and gets a very respectable 25 MPG on the highway. Being a front engine car with rear-wheel drive it feels sporty and fun. These cars are based very heavily on the Mercedes SLK, but can be had for a lot less money. Keep the top up and crank up the ice-cold A/C or drop that black soft top with the push of a button for an open air driving experience. The soft top folds nicely under a painted hard boot for a clean buttoned up look. Inside you get bucket seats, a center console, AM/FM/CD player, power windows, cruise control and tilt steering wheel. The seats are sporty yet comfortable and look great in charcoal leather. Options include: A/C, power top, power steering, power brakes, power windows, heated seats, AM/FM/CD player, leather interior, alloy wheels, radial tires, cruise control, and power locks. This car has everything you could ask for in terms of options, and youd be hard pressed to find a lower mileage, or cleaner example! This vehicle is available to view by appointment only. Please call the office to make an appointment. For additional information on this and our other classic and collectible cars for sale, please visit www.Survivor-Cars.com.

Its silhouette is less a conventional truck and more a folded plane: hard facets, razor edges and a stainlesssteel skin that seems engineered to be seen. Its architecture first, styling second a bold, polarizing statement that reads equally as sculpture and tool. Up close, the surfaces are unapologetically industrial, from a distance the Cybertrucks presence simplifies to a single, unforgettable intent: utility amplified by a futuristic aesthetic.<br /><br />Driving it is a study in modern contradictions. The electric powertrain supplies instantaneous torque that makes urban maneuvers feel brisk and oddly effortless for something of its scale, the low battery mass stabilizes the platform in corners while lending a planted sense to highspeed cruising. Acceleration is immediate, the regenerative braking reshapes city driving into a onepedal rhythm for many drivers, and the overall sensation is of a heavy, capable machine moved with the immediacy of an EV. Handling favors stability and confidence over razorsharp agility this is a truck first, but one that deploys its propulsion with sportscar momentum when called upon.<br /><br />Practicality is where the Cybertruck earns its keep. The bed is cavernous and multifunctional, the front storage compartment turns frunk space into usable volume, and the interior architecture prioritizes durability and simple utility. The cabin leans minimalist: a wide digital interface anchors the dash, controls are pared back, and the seating is focused on comfort and visibility rather than fussy luxury. Software is a defining feature overtheair updates, integrated connectivity and a suite of driver aids shape longterm ownership more than hardware spec sheets.<br /><br />Of course, the Cybertrucks uncompromising design and size carry tradeoffs. Its geometry can make tight urban parking awkward, its look invites opinion, and ownership still leans on Teslas unique service and charging ecosystem. But for buyers who prize dramatic design, workready capability and an EV experience that feels like the future arriving early, the 2025 Cybertruck Base is a striking proposition: a durable, unorthodox truck that doubles as a cultural statement and a seriously capable daily tool.<br />Recent Arrival! 2025 Tesla Cybertruck Silver 1-Speed Automatic AWD Electric Motor **Here at Sawgrass INFINITI you&#39;ll receive the expertise of our Factory Certified Sales Consultants and staff.
