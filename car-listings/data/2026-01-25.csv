The Volvo XC90 Hybrid three-row luxury SUV is upscale, quick, and efficientand it comes wrapped in a handsome body with a gorgeous Scandinavian-modern interior. Hybrid-powered luxury three-row family SUVs are a growing niche, and the 2023 Volvo XC90 Hybrid has the goods. Among luxury hybrid rivals such as the two-row Porsche Cayenne Hybrid and the BMW X5 Hybrid, the Volvo is the most fuel-efficient option. Its 455-hp powertrain conjures brisk acceleration from a turbocharged four-cylinder and electric motor, all-wheel is standard across the lineup. With its onboard battery fully charged, the XC90 Hybrid offers up to 32 miles of electric-only driving, which should be enough for many drivers daily commute. A host of tech features come standard, including a comprehensive driver-assistance suite. Premium materials line the cabin and the cozy Scandinavian vibe inside adds to the feeling of luxury. USB charging ports, a Google-based infotainment system, and an available high-end stereo system are there to ensure everyone remains connected and entertained. The XC90 T8 makes use of a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that works with a rear-axle-mounted electric motor and a 14.7-kWh battery to whip up 455 horsepower and 523 pound-feet of torque. As with all XC90s, the T8 PHEV is only available with an eight-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive. The last time we tested a plug-in hybrid T8 model, it shot to 60 mph in just 4.5 seconds at our test track.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",128,

With 31,112 miles and backed by Ford’s Blue Certified program, this Telluride offers added peace of mind through a comprehensive 139-point inspection, a 90-day/4,000-mile Comprehensive Limited Warranty, 24/7 Roadside Assistance, and fresh maintenance at delivery. Finished in Gravity Gray with a refined Black interior featuring premium Nappa leather seating, this SUV presents a sophisticated, commanding presence across Wesley Chapel, Tampa, Brandon, Clearwater, and St. Petersburg.<br /><br />Power comes from Kia’s proven 3.8L GDI DOHC V6 engine paired with a smooth 8-speed automatic transmission. This powertrain delivers confident acceleration, strong highway passing performance, and refined cruising manners. The advanced all-wheel-drive system enhances traction and stability on wet pavement, sand, or uneven surfaces, making this Telluride well suited for Florida weather conditions and road trips alike. Trailer sway control and factory towing equipment add confidence when hauling recreational gear or small trailers.<br /><br />The SX-Prestige trim represents the pinnacle of the Telluride lineup, blending luxury materials with cutting-edge technology. Inside the cabin, you’ll find heated and ventilated front bucket seats with memory, heated second-row seating, a heated leather-wrapped steering wheel, power-adjustable front seats with lumbar support, and upscale interior accents throughout. The three-row layout offers generous legroom for passengers in all rows, while the power-folding third row allows quick transitions between passenger seating and expanded cargo space.<br /><br />Technology is a standout feature. Dual panoramic digital displays combine a fully digital instrument cluster with a large touchscreen infotainment system supporting Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, Bluetooth connectivity, voice recognition, and navigation functionality. The premium 10-speaker audio system delivers rich, immersive sound, while a head-up display projects key driving information directly into the driver’s line of sight. Multiple USB ports and power outlets throughout the cabin support modern device needs for every passenger.<br /><br />Safety and driver-assist technology are extensive and confidence-inspiring. This Telluride includes Highway Driving Assist 2, Adaptive Cruise Control with Stop-and-Go, Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist with junction crossing detection, Blind Spot Monitoring with camera view, Rear Cross-Traffic Collision Avoidance, Lane Keeping Assist, Lane Following Assist, Driver Attention Warning, Parking Distance Warning with front and rear sensors, and a surround-view camera system. These systems work together to reduce driver stress and enhance awareness in both highway and city driving.<br /><br />Exterior details reinforce the SX-Prestige’s upscale presence. Features include LED projector headlamps with automatic high beams, LED fog lamps, LED brakelights, power-folding heated mirrors with turn signal indicators, deep-tinted glass, chrome exterior accents, roof rails, a hands-free power liftgate, and distinctive 20-inch black-finish alloy wheels. The bold front grille and sculpted body lines give the Telluride a refined yet rugged appearance.<br /><br />Ride quality is smooth, quiet, and composed. The Telluride absorbs road imperfections with ease while maintaining excellent highway stability and responsive steering. The elevated driving position provides outstanding visibility, and the well-insulated cabin creates a calm, comfortable environment for daily commutes or long-distance travel.<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",190.75,

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Meet your ultimate co-pilot, GPS linked cruise control.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Audi smartphone interface (Apple CarPlay/Android Auto) smart device wireless mirroring</li></ul>\nAutomatic Full-Time All-Wheel, Express Open/Close Sliding And Tilting Glass Panoramic 1st And 2nd Row Sunroof w/Power Sunshade, Perimeter/Approach Lights, 8-Way Power Driver Seat -inc: Power Recline, Height Adjustment, Fore/Aft Movement and Cushion Tilt, 8-Way Power Passenger Seat -inc: Power Recline, Height Adjustment, Fore/Aft Movement and Cushion Tilt, Heated/Cooled Front Cupholder, Perimeter Alarm, 3 12V DC Power Outlets, Audi side assist Blind Spot, Audi pre sense city, Audi Pre Sense Rear, Collision Mitigation-Front\n To be sure you don&#39;t miss out, give us a call at (888) 685-1813 and schedule a test drive.
