One Low Price is our no-hassle, no-negotiation, no-pressure purchasing experience. Our customer-focused sales staff at Astorg Auto is paid to sell you a car, but not paid on how much we make selling you that car---because we know paying sales staff on profit does not benefit the customer. One Low Price takes the risk out of paying too much for your next car. We believe everyone should pay the same fair price for a vehicle, regardless of ability to negotiate. We rigorously research both local and national markets to ensure that every vehicle is priced fairly. Then we go a step further and place that One Low Price on the windshield of every vehicle. This provides our customers with a fair, up-front, and transparent purchasing experience.

It arrives as if on cue: a coupelike roofline that slices the horizon, hips that broaden into a confident stance and surfacing that plays with light like a sculpture catching a sunset. It isnt shy about presence, rather, it choreographs it. From some angles its athletic, from others almost aristocratic a crossover that has learned how to be both predator and patron of the pavement.<br /><br />Approach and the details reward a slow look. The face is assertive but refined, the grille and lamps arranged less for flash and more for attitude. The sweep of the shoulder, the tucked rear, the way the wheels fill their arches all suggest motion even when the car is politely stationary. Its a silhouette designed to age well: bold enough to be noticed, tasteful enough to keep you noticing.<br /><br />Slide in and the cabin feels like a private study crafted for motion. Materials are chosen for touch and temperament soft leather, purposeful stitching, and trim that catches light without shouting. The cockpit wraps around the driver with an inviting focus, controls fall naturally to hand and the seating encourages a posture thats both commanding and comfortable. Ambient lighting and a quiet acoustic palette make the interior feel like a sanctuary where conversation, music and concentration coexist with ease.<br /><br />On the road the X6s personality reveals itself in layered ways. Steering is authoritative, turning directional intent into composed action, the chassis balances poise with playful willingness, ready to tighten when you ask and to smooth when you dont. Acceleration is confident rather than theatrical, delivering momentum with a dignified immediacy that invites engagement without demanding it. The soundtrack is measured a low, persuasive growl that underscores movement rather than dominates it.<br /><br />Technology and convenience are integrated with discretion: helpful, contemporary and designed to enhance the experience rather than distract from it. Practical touches abound without spoiling the mood, luggage space and seating flexibility keep errands practical while preserving the cars dramatic temperament.<br /><br />In short, the 2022 BMW X6 xDrive40i is a study in controlled charisma: sculptural presence, refined interiors and a driving demeanor that rewards intention. Its a car that wants to be noticed, but only because it knows how to deserve the attention.<br />Recent Arrival! 2022 BMW X6 xDrive40i Alpine White Cognac Leather. 8-Speed Automatic Sport AWD 3.0L I6 DOHC 24V Turbocharged **Here at Sawgrass INFINITI you&#39;ll receive the expertise of our Factory Certified Sales Consultants and staff.

One Low Price is our no-hassle, no-negotiation, no-pressure purchasing experience. Our customer-focused sales staff at Astorg Auto is paid to sell you a car, but not paid on how much we make selling you that car---because we know paying sales staff on profit does not benefit the customer. One Low Price takes the risk out of paying too much for your next car. We believe everyone should pay the same fair price for a vehicle, regardless of ability to negotiate. We rigorously research both local and national markets to ensure that every vehicle is priced fairly. Then we go a step further and place that One Low Price on the windshield of every vehicle. This provides our customers with a fair, up-front, and transparent purchasing experience. WHAT'S INCLUDED * One Low Price clearly listed on every vehicle * All rebates and incentives included up front * Priced determined by rigorously researching both local and national markets and trusted third-party sources * Every customer pays the same One Low Price.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",153,

One Low Price is our no-hassle, no-negotiation, no-pressure purchasing experience. Our customer-focused sales staff at Astorg Auto is paid to sell you a car, but not paid on how much we make selling you that car---because we know paying sales staff on profit does not benefit the customer. One Low Price takes the risk out of paying too much for your next car. We believe everyone should pay the same fair price for a vehicle, regardless of ability to negotiate. We rigorously research both local and national markets to ensure that every vehicle is priced fairly. Then we go a step further and place that One Low Price on the windshield of every vehicle. This provides our customers with a fair, up-front, and transparent purchasing experience. WHAT'S INCLUDED * One Low Price clearly listed on every vehicle * All rebates and incentives included up front * Priced determined by rigorously researching both local and national markets and trusted third-party sources * Every customer pays the same One Low Price.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",150.95,

Glacier-Forged Dragon of Ingolstadt<br /><br />From the frozen forges of Audi Sport there came a creature of impossible balance.<br /><br />A dragon sculpted not from scales, but from sheet metal and

touch.<br /><br />She was traded in against a Golf R, but not because she was outmatched.<br />No.<br />Only because some souls are called to different forms of magic.<br /><br />Inside her chest beats a 2.9 liter twin-turbocharged V6, a heart tuned by runes and engineers to summon 444 horsepower.<br />When stirred, it does not purr.<br /><br />It exhales flame, crackling and roaring through the forested roads of the West Coast, where she lived her life under gentle weather and careful stewardship.<br /><br />Her past is spotless.

She is royal.<br />She carries Fine Nappa Leather stitched in Crescendo Red, a pattern that looks almost ceremonial, like the markings of a noble house.<br />Her S Sport seats cradle riders like saddles meant for war.<br />Her heated steering wheel warms the hands of the knight who dares command her.<br />Her 19-speaker sound system fills the cabin with music worthy of a hall of kings.<br />The Black Optic Package tempers her beauty with shadow.<br />High gloss black mirrors, spoilers, and diffusers glint like obsidian plating.<br />Her 20-inch forged Flag-Design wheels turn like twin crests, sharp and defiant.<br />Her mind is keen and watchful.<br />Adaptive Cruise Control with Traffic Jam Assist.<br />Active Lane Assist.<br />Park Assist.<br />Top View Camera System.<br />Traffic Sign Recognition.<br />A Head-Up Display that projects the roads prophecy onto the air before her.<br />And when she opens her power moonroof, the sky peers inside, as if curious about the creature beneath.<br />She is the product of the RS mind.<br />Part speed.<br />Part grace.<br />Part winter.<br />Part fire.<br />She is the Glacier-Forged Dragon, the firebreather dressed in ice,<br />returned now to your halls and awaiting the next worthy rider.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-off cruise control - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-off cruise control.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Audi smartphone interface w/wireless Apple CarPlay smart device wireless mirroring</li><li> Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly. Connect your devices to the Internet through your vehicle&#39;s private mobile hotspot and take the internet wherever your journey takes you, without eating up your data allowance. Find the hotspot with mobile hotspot.</li></ul>\n\n To be sure you don&#39;t miss out, give us a call at (888) 685-1813 and schedule a test drive.

We surveyed hundreds of our past clients to find out how they want to purchase a vehicle and we have listened. We designed a fast, fair, and simple process to save you time and eliminate the need for the back-and-forth that out clients have told us they dislike (or even hate!). You will find that we do things very different than you may have experienced in the past and have come to expect with other dealers. We call this: Simple Price, Simple Process! Our Simple Price will be the same regardless of where you see our vehicle. We do extensive research to know the market. We utilize the same reliable tools you may use (Kelley Blue Book, Edmunds, Craigslist, etc), as well as some others (sales data, auction data, shopping our competition), to offer every vehicle at a very fair and aggressive market-based purchase price. We use this process for every vehicle, new and used, to eliminate the need for back-and-forth negotiations. Our clients have told us that this develops trust and the confidence to purchase. This saves our clients time (in some cases even hours or days of negotiation) and provides the 100% transparent experience our clients tell us they want.<br /><br />From your first contact with us (call, text, email or store visit), to the time you drive away in your new vehicle, our Simple Price and Simple Process will save you time. You will work with only one person from beginning to end. Your professional Sales Manager will present the vehicle you have selected and offer to share any others that are similar. Once you have selected the vehicle you would like to own, there is no need to negotiate. In addition, Toyota Sunnyvale’s Simple Process has been streamlined by eliminating the wait for the “Finance Department,” saving you an hour (or two) to see a finance manager. Your Sales Manager invests an additional 30&#43; hours per year of training to professionally offer your protection options. They already","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",173.45,

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system.

One Owner! \n\n <b>OTHER NOTABLE FEATURES AND OPTIONS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT:</b>\n\n\n\nComfort<ul><li> Power reclining driver seat - Lean back. Gain some space between you and the wheel with power reclining driver seat. It lets you adjust the angle of the seatback at the touch of a button for added comfort while you&#39;re driving, or for a more comfortable rest while you&#39;re pulled over. Settle in, with power reclining driver seat.</li></ul>Convenience<ul><li> Cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful, until cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed using the steering wheel mounted controls and it will maintain that speed without driver intervention. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.</li></ul>Powertrain and Mechanical<ul><li> Variable valve timing - Change your output. There are a lot of variables in your drive, so why should your engine always operate the same? With variable valve timing, the engine is efficient at both low and high RPM&#39;s, so you get better fuel efficiency, cleaner emissions and improved performance. Variable valve timing provides a better drive, every time.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li></ul>\n\nWHEEL LOCKS\n You can&#39;t buy the wrong car.

One Owner! \n <b>OTHER NOTABLE FEATURES AND OPTIONS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT:</b>\n\n\n\n\n\nSafety and Security<ul><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system.

Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with Distance pacing cruise control with traffic stop-go, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and the vehicle ahead. It&#39;s stop/go feature automatically brings the vehicle to a stop if traffic stops and resumes distance pacing cruise when traffic starts to move again. Distance pacing cruise control with traffic stop-go, your ultimate co-pilot.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Apple CarPlay Compatibility smart device wireless mirroring</li></ul>\n\nICONIC TRIM, WHEELS: 17\&#39; X 7\&#39; SILVER TENTACLE SPOKE, BLACK PEARL LT CHEQUERED, CLOTH/LEATHERETTE UPHOLSTERY, BLACK ROOF &amp; MIRROR CAPS, PIANO BLACK EXTERIOR TRIM, NAPPA LEATHER STEERING WHEEL, ALUMINUM INTERIOR SURFACE, STORAGE PACKAGE, UNIVERSAL GARAGE-DOOR OPENER \n\n\n ** Every vehicle we offer comes equipped with 3 year monitoring from LoJack for the additional price of $795.

Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li><li> Hands-off cruise control - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane.

We have known this car since it had just 230 miles on the odometer, it was sold new here at Napleton&#39;s Toyota of Brookfield and has returned to our service bays for nearly every milestone of its life. Boasting a Toyota Silver Certified status and a 1-owner history with zero accidents, this Prius is officially &#34;Well Maintained&#34; by CARFAX standards. With only 52,235 miles, well below the industry average, this fuel-sipping hatchback is ready to provide years of worry-free driving. Read on to see how we&#39;ve kept this local gem in showroom condition.<br /><br />Because this vehicle has been &#34;Homegrown&#34; in our shop, it easily qualified for the Toyota Silver Certification. This means it has passed a rigorous 136-point inspection and comes with a 12-month/12,000-mile Limited Powertrain Warranty, along with 24-hour Roadside Assistance.<br /><br />Our service records show a disciplined history of maintenance. In April 2025, we performed a full fuel injection system flush and induction service to maximize its hybrid economy. At that same visit, we installed four brand-new tires, performed a precision alignment, and balanced the wheels.
