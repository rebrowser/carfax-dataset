Ordered with the highly desirable Premium Package, it brings BOSE Surround Sound, ventilated front seats, PDLS+ headlights, Surround View, Lane Change Assist, and ambient lighting, making top-down driving both luxurious and effortless. The Sport Chrono Package and black Sport Tailpipes add performance character, while the 20""/21"" Carrera Classic wheels and Racing Yellow-accented tachometer, stopwatch, and seat belts tie the entire aesthetic together with purpose and flair. This particular car was selected after an enthusiast meticulously searched for a 911 that wasn't just well-equipped, but truly special - a build that felt tailored rather than typical. When this Cabriolet appeared, its condition and specification made it clear it was the one worth pursuing. Today it stands as a beautifully preserved, tastefully optioned 911 that blends performance, luxury, and personality in a way few examples do.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",174,

More information about the 2015 GMC Sierra 1500:The 2015 GMC Sierra 1500 lineup comprises a set of pickups aimed at a wide range of uses, from personal transportation to purpose-built tow rigs, farm or ranch haulers, or off-road machines. With three cab styles, two bed lengths, three engines, 2-wheel and 4-wheel drive versions, and various trim levels from spartan to lavish, the Sierra lineup offers something for all. Top-of-the-line Denali models remain the choice of more discerning truck shoppers, with luxurious interiors and the full set of features of a premium SUV. The Sierra is a quiet truck, thanks to a host of sound-deadening additions like triple-sealed doors and aerodynamic measures. The Sierra&#39;s refined engines are strong yet fuel-efficient. GM boasts that models with the V6 have towing ratings of up to 7,600 pounds, which is hundreds of pounds more than a comparable Ford F-150 or Ram 1500. Also, the Sierra 1500 might have some of the lowest maintenance costs among pickups because of its 4-wheel disc brakes with Duralife rotors, which GM claims will last twice as long as conventional brake rotors.This model sets itself apart with innovative cargo solutions, upgraded connectivity and entertainment systems, quiet, stylish cabins, and Strong, efficient engines<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",138.75,

Under the long sculpted hood lies a re-engineered 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 with a flat-plane crankshaft, producing 720 horsepower and 590 lb-ft of torque. Paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission and rear-wheel drive, the GT Black Series accelerates from 0-60 mph in just 3.1 seconds and reaches a top speed of 202 mph. Power delivery is instantaneous, linear, and ferocious. The Black Series name is reserved for the rarest and most focused AMG models, and this GT wears it proudly. Its carbon-fiber bodywork and a massive adjustable rear wing generate track-level downforce. A race-derived coil-over suspension with adaptive damping, carbon-ceramic brakes, and Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 R tires ensure razor-sharp handling and unshakeable grip. Inside, the GT Black Series remains unapologetically driver-focused. Lightweight AMG Performance bucket seats, Alcantara upholstery, carbon-fiber trim, and silver contrast stitching set the tone for serious performance. The AMG digital cockpit and infotainment interface keep vital information front and center, while creature comforts like dual-zone climate control and Burmester premium audio make it surprisingly livable when the helmet comes off. Born on the racetrack, bred by AMG&#39;s most obsessive engineers, and built in limited numbers, the 2021 Mercedes-AMG GT Black Series represents the peak of Mercedes performance. For collectors and purists alike, it&#39;s one of the most extraordinary and capable front-engine supercars of the modern era.<br /><br />OPTIONAL EQUIPMENT<br />Cirrus Silver Metallic $720<br />Black w/Silver Nappa/Dinamica <br />AMG Matte Carbon Fiber Trim<br />Burmester High End 3D Surround Sound System $4,500<br />Matte Carbon Fiber Crossbar $1,600<br />AMG Carbon Fiber Door Sill Covers $1,200<br />Lane Tracking Package $875<br />Lane Keeping Assist<br />Blind Spot Assist<br />Keyless Go Package $550<br />Silver Seat Belts $500<br />Fitted Indoor Car Cover $370<br />Wheel Locking Bolts $150<br /><br />GENERAL<br />Year: 2021<br />Mileage: 366<br />VIN #: W1KYJ8BA2MA042728<br />Engine Size: 4.0L V8 (Biturbo) <br />Class: Coupe<br />Horsepower: 720<br />Color: Cirrus Silver Metallic<br />Interior: Black Nappa Leather <br />Fuel: Unleaded Premium Gasoline<br />Gear Box: 7-Speed Automatic<br />Doors: 2<br />Seats: 2<br />Cylinders: 8<br /><br />SAFETY EQUIPMENT<br />Outboard Front Lap and Shoulder Safety Belts<br />Airbag Occupancy Sensor<br />Dual Stage Driver and Passenger Front Airbags<br />Tire Specific Low Tire Pressure Warning<br />Traction Control<br />Anti-Locking Brakes<br />Perimeter Alarm<br /><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />1 Key Included<br />Balance of Factory Warranty (if applicable)<br />Extended Warranties Available","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",151.75,

It should be understood that the displayed vehicles are a sampling of what may be available, not every vehicle will be continuously available at all times for every consumer, and additional similar vehicles may be available but not yet posted. Due to the high demand for our individually selected vehicle inventory, there may be times when an individual vehicle is no longer available at the time you arrive at the dealership. This may occur due to a time delay between posting the vehicle, its actual sale and delivery, and its removal from the website. Posting, sale, and delivery of all pre-owned vehicles is an evolving process, and occasionally displayed vehicles may not be available for a variety of reasons, including prior sale, removal or transport to another location, or awaiting title and ownership confirmation.

With just over 7,000 miles and priced well below original MSRP, it delivers huge value for families who want space, technology, and lower fuel costs without paying full new-car pricing.<br /><br />This Carnival is a CARFAX One Owner and Kia Certified Pre-Owned, meaning it’s been through a full 165-point inspection and comes with factory-backed warranty coverage. Original MSRP was over $53K, and this one lands in a far more comfortable price range with the heavy depreciation already behind it.<br /><br />The Hybrid SX trim is fully loaded. You’ll find heated and ventilated front seats, memory seating, navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, power liftgate, rain-sensing wipers, and a smooth, quiet hybrid powertrain delivering up to 34 MPG city. The dual-screen rear seat entertainment system and power second-row moonroof make this an easy win for families with kids or anyone who spends time on the road.<br /><br />The Carnival continues to be one of the most comfortable and versatile family vehicles available. If you’re cross-shopping a Toyota Sienna Hybrid, Honda Odyssey, or Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, the Carnival stands out for interior design, technology, and long-term warranty coverage.<br /><br />As a Kia Certified vehicle, this Carnival includes a 10-year or 100,000-mile powertrain limited warranty from the original in-service date, 12-month or 12,000-mile Platinum coverage, roadside assistance, rental car reimbursement, transferable warranty, and a low deductible. That’s thousands in coverage included at no extra cost.<br /><br />At Ewald Kia of Oconomowoc, we keep things simple and transparent. Family-owned since 1964. No pressure, no games, just smart vehicles priced the right way for buyers across Oconomowoc, Milwaukee, Waukesha, and Madison.<br /><br />Low-mile, certified Carnival Hybrid SX models don’t come around often. Confirm availability and come see it before another family figures out how good of a buy this really is.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",124.25,

It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane. Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.</li><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li></ul>\n\n \n At Albrecht Subaru of Wakefield, we&#39;re here to <b>Serve you!</b> Our staff is 100% dedicated to customer satisfaction and we understand that you need clear, transparent information throughout the car buying process.

Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them.

If you need to schedule any of these services, please call our dealership.<br />When buying an used vehicle, we want to make sure you get your money’s worth. To ensure this, we put all our used vehicles through a service reconditioning process. This process includes a 106-point inspection of the vehicle to ensure that it’s up to our standards. We make sure the tires have three 30-second tire depths or 30%, if they don’t, we’ll replace the tires. We’ll also replace any brakes over 3mm. After the vehicles full inspection, it leaves the shop and goes through cosmetic refurbishing where we inspect and replace scratches, dents, scuffs, and road rash, as well as interior leather and upholstery reconditioning. While we work hard to ensure the quality of all used vehicles, we must acknowledge that some will end up with defects. Speak with one of our sales specialists about an used vehicle you’re interested in to get a history of the car. Bob Moore also covers all your INFINITI, and any other make or model, service needs with our factory trained technicians, including 4 master certified technicians.
