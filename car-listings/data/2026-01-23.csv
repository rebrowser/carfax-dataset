We serve all the Oklahoma City metro including Oklahoma City, Edmond, Moore, Norman, and more. If you’re looking for a local car dealership that offers new INFINITIs, used vehicles of all makes and models, exceptional service, and multiple finance options we’ve got you covered. Looking for used vehicles for sale in Oklahoma City? At Bob Moore INFINITI we have a large assortment of used vehicles including a variety of makes and models. While we carry many used makes and models, we also carry used INFINITIs in case you aren’t looking for new models. If you’re still trying to decide which model and trim is the best fit, we can get you with one of our certified INFINITI specialists to go over all the details — whether it’s regarding features, warranties, service, financing, or any other areas you’d like addressed. Our dealership also offers a variety of amenities, free Wi-Fi, and all kinds of perks. For those wishing to shop for their car online, we can help you with that as well. All our inventory is held on our website where you can complete the whole purchase process. If you’d like to visit the dealership but need assistance getting there, we offer free valet service within 30 minutes of our store and give free at-home delivery. If you need to schedule any of these services, please call our dealership.<br />When buying an used vehicle, we want to make sure you get your money’s worth. To ensure this, we put all our used vehicles through a service reconditioning process. This process includes a 106-point inspection of the vehicle to ensure that it’s up to our standards. We make sure the tires have three 30-second tire depths or 30%, if they don’t, we’ll replace the tires. We’ll also replace any brakes over 3mm. After the vehicles full inspection, it leaves the shop and goes through cosmetic refurbishing where we inspect and replace scratches, dents, scuffs, and road rash, as well as interior leather and upholstery reconditioning. While we work hard to ensure the quality of all used vehicles, we must acknowledge that some will end up with defects. Speak with one of our sales specialists about an used vehicle you’re interested in to get a history of the car. Bob Moore also covers all your INFINITI, and any other make or model, service needs with our factory trained technicians, including 4 master certified technicians. This includes a complimentary car wash and vacuum with every service. Prior to your service, contact our dealership team to get your service appointment set up. Financing a vehicle purchase can be a stressful process but Bob Moore INFINITI offers a seamless auto financing, with over 20 lenders to work with. This helps us ensure that we’re getting you the best deal possible for your new car. If you have any questions when going through the financing, don’t stress. We’ll have our INFINITI finance expert there with you to answer any questions or c","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",173,

This RX 400h brings together Lexus luxury, well-engineered hybrid performance, and outstanding real-world efficiency in a refined midsize crossover that remains exceptionally practical and comfortable today. Powertrain and Efficiency Under the hood sits the renowned 3.3L V6 hybrid system paired with Lexus’ electric drive components, delivering a combined 268 horsepower and the smooth, immediate response associated with hybrid torque delivery. The full-time all-wheel-drive system provides extra traction and confidence in a variety of driving conditions, while the electronic continuously variable-style hybrid transmission contributes to seamless acceleration. This specific vehicle has below 136,000 miles — averaging less than 7,000 miles per year — and consistently posts excellent fuel economy for its class: an EPA-style rating of approximately 27 MPG in the city and 25 MPG on the highway. That makes this RX 400h a great choice for both daily commuting and longer highway trips where the hybrid system’s efficiency shines. Condition and History This vehicle is in excellent overall condition and presents extremely well inside and out. The Neptune Blue Mica paint retains a deep, glossy finish and pairs beautifully with the Ivory leather interior, which presents a bright, inviting cabin atmosphere that feels both modern and timeless. The car has a clean CARFAX report — a reassuring sign of responsible ownership and well-documented maintenance. Factory Default Features — Detailed Overview This 2007 RX 400h was built to offer a refined and feature-rich ownership experience right from the factory. Below is a detailed look at the factory-default features you’ll enjoy: Exterior and Convenience - Distinctive Neptune Blue Mica paint with a premium clearcoat finish for depth and durability. - Halogen projector-beam headlamps with auto-on/off function to enhance nighttime visibility. - Integrated fog lamps for improved low-visibility driving. - Power-folding side mirrors with body-color finish and integrated turn indicators on many factory configurations. - Power liftgate for convenient hands-free loading and unloading of cargo. - Roof rails for flexible cargo-carrying options (cross bars available as accessories). - Lightweight alloy wheels that combine a polished look with strong performance characteristics and help to reduce unsprung weight. Interior Comfort and Convenience - Ivory leather-trimmed seating that offers a luxurious feel and a bright, airy interior ambiance. The seats are supportive for long drives and easy to maintain. - Power-adjustable front seats with driver memory settings to store preferred seating and mirror positions. - Heated front seats to provide quick warmth on chilly mornings. - Split-folding 60/40 rear seats that fold flat to expand cargo capacity and make the cabin versatile for passengers and gear. - Dual-zone automatic climate control to keep driver and front passenger comfortable with individually controlled temperatures. - Power windows, power door locks, and remote keyless entry for everyday convenience. - Tilt-and-telescoping steering column for personalized driving ergonomics. - Multifunction steering wheel controls for audio and cruise control, enabling safer, more convenient operation while driving. - Interior woodgrain and metallic trim accents that add a touch of upscale styling and warmth to the cabin. Audio and Connectivity - A premium factory audio system tuned by Lexus to provide clear, balanced sound throughout the cabin. The system includes AM/FM radio and CD playback, many factory configurations also included an in-dash multi-disc CD changer. - Auxiliary audio input capability for connecting portable music players (adapter/cable optio","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",190.7,

She drove it til the engine blew up, had it towed to her mechanic, and then promptly died. Mechanic called his buddy and said I&#39;ve got a one-owner, low mile Jimmy with a blown motor and a low mile (67k) TBI 350 out of an &#39;87 Firebird Formula. Should bolt right in. Had all the accessories, including AC components, so he got it mounted in there and sold it to us. We have been pick-pick-picking away at it here and there. Got it running great, had Exhaustworks (on Fort Lowell. The good one) put in new exhaust, including cats, all the way to Flowmasters with chrome tips angled down tastefully out the back. Starts right up every time, runs strong, and needs to be finished up.$8850 out the door. Good rubber, new windshield, and such a friggin flex.

A REALLY SHARP PATHINFDER!! Goldie's Motors has implemented a new transparent and aggressive pricing structure. To be competitive and give our customers the best possible value. We are pricing select vehicles at or below our cost. We only charge a $385.00 doc fee plus an additional $1,000 on top of the sale price, which is the majority of our total profit on the car. Our fees will include a complete vehicle inspection, window tinting, floor mats, and a complete detail. There are absolutely no hidden costs or miscellaneous fees. Our total vehicle costs will be hard to beat! In addition, we will not sacrifice the quality of our vehicles and continue to go through each car thoroughly. We aim to increase our volume and offer our customers the best possible experience. We are a family-owned store. Both of our owners (brothers) are based in Arizona. The store is staffed with residents, veterans, and retirees, and we all contribute to the success of our community. Our kids go to the local schools, we donate to local charities, and we volunteer throughout our communities. We would appreciate the opportunity to earn your business. We just got this sharp and very well-cared-for premium suv from a very trusted national lender. The last owner took really nice care of this Nissan. It has a fantastic 57,469 miles, that is only an average of 7,183 miles driven per year!! The very sharp and upgraded pearl white exterior paint looks great and is in excellent condition especially for its year and the miles. The equally sharp premium interior is equally nice and has been well-maintained, there is no sign it has been smoked in. This is very well equipped with all the options listed above, plus a long, long list of factory upgrades that make it a very, very nice upgraded luxury suv that looks and drives great — and the overall condition reflects how well it’s been cared for. The Carfax shows a very minor incident , there is absolutely no sign of repair. It looks great!! In addition it has just been fully serviced by our Nissan specialist, including a comprehensive multi-point pre-owned vehicle inspection, and everything checked out in excellent condition. Since this is a Carfax-certified vehicle with an excellent service history and a fully completed pre-owned inspection, it qualifies for several certified pre-owned (CPO) extended warranty options at reduced rates. Our family environment and great pricing not only make Goldie’s Motors one of the most comfortable places to buy a car, but it also makes us one of the FASTEST. You can drive out of our dealership in less than an hour after selecting your future car! WE ARE OPEN 6 DAYS A WEEK.

Finished in stunning Glacier Gray Metallic Tri-Coat and offered as a one-owner vehicle with a clean Carfax, this F-450 delivers unmatched capability paired with high-end comfort and aggressive custom styling.Under the hood is Fords legendary 6.7L High Output Power Stroke Turbo Diesel V8, producing an astonishing 500 horsepower and 1,200 lb-ft of torque, making this one of the most powerful pickup trucks ever built. This engine delivers effortless towing, brutal low-end torque, and dominant highway performance in any situation. Paired with 4WD, a 4.30 limited-slip rear axle, and the FX4 Off-Road Package, this truck is engineered for extreme hauling, heavy trailers, and off-road confidence. While heavy-duty trucks are not EPA rated, real-world owners typically report 1418 MPG on the highway, which is exceptional for a dually of this size and capability.Inside, the Platinum trim offers true flagship-level luxury. Youll enjoy exclusive Platinum leather seating, heated and ventilated front seats, memory driver seat and pedals, panoramic sunroof, heads-up display, built-in navigation, and the incredible B&O Unleashed Sound System by Bang & Olufsen that delivers premium, concert-quality audio. Technology is top-tier with the Ford Connectivity Package including 5G modem, SiriusXM 360L, Pro Power Onboard 2kW, and a fully digital cockpit designed for modern connectivity and convenience.Safety and driver-assist features include blind spot monitoring, electronic stability control, hill descent control, auto high-beam headlights, flow-through center console, and advanced braking and stability systems that provide confidence whether youre towing or cruising.What truly separates this F-450 from anything else on the road are its high-end aftermarket upgrades. This truck features a professionally installed 3-inch lift kit, massive 24-inch Arena wheels, and aggressive 37-inch mud terrain tires, giving it a dominating stance, increased ground clearance, and an unmatched visual presence. These upgrades dramatically enhance both off-road capability and street appeal, making this truck as bold as it is capable.With dual rear wheels, the 14,000 lb GVWR payload package, off-road tuned shock absorbers, and factory FX4 enhancements, this F-450 is built for extreme workloads while still delivering first-class luxury and ride quality.Most importantly, this F-450 has been fully inspected, runs and drives like new, and represents a rare opportunity to own a nearly new Platinum diesel with ultra-low miles and premium custom upgrades. Finding a truck with this combination of condition, power, luxury, and aftermarket build is extremely rare.This vehicle is available now at Covert Ford of Hutto.

At Sunset, we believe value goes far beyond just the price tag. The average cost of an extended powertrain warranty can cost up to $1,600 per year. With the average vehicle ownership in the U.S. Now lasting around 8.5 years, that can add up to nearly $13,600. Sunset’s exclusive ""Warranty Protection for Life"" offers this peace of mind at no additional cost, saving you thousands during the ownership of your vehicle. In addition, the average cost of an oil change these days can run you as much as $150 per service ... more if you are driving a diesel truck ...and those prices are not likely to be going down, right? Sunset's ""Oil Changes For Life"" includes up to five (5) oil changes per year. Based on your driving habits, this means you could be spending over $750 - $1000 annually... just on oil changes! That’s crazy! In short, paying the lowest price doesn’t always mean getting the best deal. At Sunset, you get more: more protection, more savings, and more value throughout your vehicle ownership. You just get more at Sunset, and people DO like that. Price may include $9,999 dealer added accessories or $9,999 worth of accessories may be added to price..","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",121,
