More information about the 2017 Chevrolet Volt: The Chevrolet Volt starts at around $33,000 and competes in the mid-sized sedan segment, but it&#39;s somewhat unique status as a plug-in hybrid sets the Volt apart from much of the market. With over 50 miles of electric range, it&#39;s likely that most owners will get around purely on electric power much of the time they&#39;re driving the Volt. However, range anxiety should be non-existent, as the Volt does have a gasoline engine available to recharge the batteries when needed. Chevrolet estimates a total range of about 420 miles if the Volt is not recharged via an external source. Interesting features of this model are excellent smartphone integration, bigger than expected interior, and Extraordinary efficiency without the range anxiety<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",102.45,

As part of Infiniti’s lineup, the Q50 aims to bridge everyday usability with a touch of athleticism, appealing to drivers who want both comfort and a dynamic driving experience without stepping into full-on performance-car territory. Visually, the 2017 Q50 presents a sleek and modern profile. Its design is characterized by smooth lines, a sculpted hood, and a confident stance enhanced by an aggressive front grille and LED lighting elements. From the side, the flowing roofline and crisp beltline convey a sense of motion even at a standstill. The AWD model adds a planted look, with wider wheel arches and substantial tires that hint at its capability in varied weather conditions. Under the hood, the 2.0T model is powered by a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. While not as powerful as the larger V6 options in the Q50 lineup, this engine delivers a pleasant balance of responsiveness and efficiency. Turbocharging helps provide brisk acceleration, especially when paired with the sedan’s smooth-shifting automatic transmission. The AWD system contributes to confident traction in rain and light snow, bolstering the car’s all-season usability. Handling is composed, with relatively quick steering and a suspension that absorbs road imperfections well, making the Q50 comfortable on long highway stretches and engaging on winding backroads. Inside, the cabin exemplifies Infiniti’s commitment to luxury. High-quality materials, including soft-touch surfaces and available leather seating, create an upscale atmosphere. The seating is supportive and comfortable, with ample room for front occupants and reasonable space for rear passengers. The trunk offers enough cargo capacity for daily needs and weekend gear, while thoughtful storage solutions help keep essentials organized. Technology is a focal point, with dual touchscreen displays that control infotainment and vehicle settings. Smartphone integration, navigation, and a premium audio system are available, enhancing connectivity and entertainment on the go. The Premium trim includes desirable features such as heated front seats, keyless entry and ignition, and advanced driver-assistance systems. Safety features like forward collision warning, automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and blind-spot monitoring help elevate confidence behind the wheel. Fuel economy for the 2.0T AWD is competitive within the luxury segment, making the Q50 suitable for both daily commuting and longer journeys. Overall, the 2017 Infiniti Q50 2.0T Premium AWD delivers a compelling blend of performance, luxury, and technology in a refined sedan package.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",167.25,

This is one of those rare vehicles that comes along for just a brief moment. More information about the 2017 Chevrolet Volt: The Chevrolet Volt starts at around $33,000 and competes in the mid-sized sedan segment, but it&#39;s somewhat unique status as a plug-in hybrid sets the Volt apart from much of the market. With over 50 miles of electric range, it&#39;s likely that most owners will get around purely on electric power much of the time they&#39;re driving the Volt. However, range anxiety should be non-existent, as the Volt does have a gasoline engine available to recharge the batteries when needed. Chevrolet estimates a total range of about 420 miles if the Volt is not recharged via an external source. This model sets itself apart with excellent smartphone integration, bigger than expected interior, and Extraordinary efficiency without the range anxiety<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",158.9,

Powered by Honda’s 1.5L Turbocharged inline-4 producing 192 horsepower and 192 lb-ft of torque, the Accord LX delivers a balanced blend of everyday responsiveness and excellent fuel economy — an EPA rating of approximately 30 MPG city and 38 MPG highway. Finished in a deep Crystal Black Pearl exterior with Black premium cloth upholstery, this particular example is in excellent overall condition, carries a clean CARFAX report, and shows a single previous owner. Exterior The Crystal Black Pearl paint presents beautifully on the Accord’s sculpted bodywork. The LX trim features Honda’s clean, aerodynamic design language with crisply defined character lines and a broad stance that projects stability and sophistication. Exterior equipment includes power side mirrors, a handsomely integrated rear trunk spoiler, and clear-lens lighting elements. The front fascia and grille are designed to provide both a modern appearance and improved airflow. Wheels are appropriately scaled to the LX trim, contributing to a comfortable ride and confident handling. Overall exterior condition on this vehicle is excellent, with well-maintained paint and trim showing normal, low-wear use for its model year. Interior and Comfort Step inside to a practical and comfortable cabin trimmed in Black premium cloth. The seating is supportive and designed for long-distance comfort for up to five occupants. Front seats offer good bolstering, and the driver’s position includes an adjustable steering column (tilt and telescoping) for a customized driving posture. Rear passengers benefit from generous legroom and a 60/40 split-folding rear seat that enhances cargo versatility. Interior materials are thoughtfully selected for durability and ease of maintenance, with contrast stitching and tasteful trim accents that elevate perceived quality. Convenience and Storage The Accord LX is equipped with a number of everyday convenience features straight from the factory: power door locks and power windows with one-touch up/down driver window functionality, remote keyless entry, and a multi-function center console with storage cubbies and cupholders. The trunk delivers ample cargo capacity for the class (approximately 16.7 cubic feet), plus easy access via a wide opening and low liftover height — making grocery runs, luggage loading and the occasional bulky item straightforward. Infotainment and Connectivity Factory infotainment equipment provides modern smartphone integration and simple, intuitive controls. The system includes a responsive touchscreen interface with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility to mirror familiar apps and navigation from your phone, as well as Bluetooth hands-free calling and audio streaming. Steering-wheel-mounted audio and phone controls keep common functions within easy reach, while USB ports provide charging and device connectivity. A multi-angle rearview camera aids in reverse maneuvering and parking. Powertrain and Driving Dynamics Under the hood, the 1.5L Turbo I4 produces 192 hp and 192 lb-ft of torque, routed through a smooth continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) to the front wheels. The result is a vehicle that feels lively around town and composed on the highway.

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Meet your ultimate co-pilot, GPS linked cruise control.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car.

From afar it reads like a familiar silhouette remade for the future: taut hips and a low, deliberate nose that recall Porsche lineage, but the details are translated into an electric tautness. The profile is elegant rather than aggressive, a study in proportions that suggest speed even at rest, the effect is quietly provocative, promising performance delivered with clarity rather than bluster.<br /><br />Slide inside and the Taycan greets you with a cockpit that feels both minimalist and meticulously considered. Surfaces are sculpted to meet the hand, materials chosen for tactile satisfaction: soft leathers, variant trims that feel purposeful, and switchgear with satisfying resistance. The drivers seat becomes a stage the console, a concise instrument cluster of screens and touchpoints that prioritize focus. Technology is present but disciplined, it assists rather than overwhelms, keeping the sensory world of road, wheel and tire at the center of the experience.<br /><br />On the road the Taycans argument is subtle and persuasive. Theres an immediate, almost invisible shove that defines electric propulsion: acceleration arrives with blunt efficiency and near-surgical poise, surging forward without the mechanical drama of an internal combustion engine. The cars low center of gravity and balanced chassis make cornering feel surgical and confident, steering is crisp and communicative, encouraging precise placement and rewarding commitment. Regenerative braking becomes another tool of expression rather than an afterthought, allowing a rhythm of single-pedal control that feels modern and satisfying.<br /><br />Acoustically, the Taycan plays a different game. Silence is part of the charm, punctuated by a composed mechanical whirr and the tasteful augmentation of sound when one desires drama. The result is intimacy a cabin where conversation and music exist alongside kinetic intensity.<br /><br />Practicalities arent ignored: luggage space and everyday ergonomics are thoughtfully integrated, letting the Taycan double as both a daily companion and an occasional provocateur. In short, the 2021 Taycan Base is a refined electric athlete restrained, incisive and emotionally calibrated for drivers who appreciate performance served with intellectual elegance.<br />Recent Arrival! 2021 Porsche Taycan White 2-Speed Automatic RWD Electric Motor **Here at Sawgrass INFINITI you&#39;ll receive the expertise of our Factory Certified Sales Consultants and staff.
