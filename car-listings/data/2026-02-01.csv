Key Advantages Comprehensive Safety Features: The Touring trim includes the full EyeSight suite of active safety features, which was enhanced for 2020 to include lane centering. It also uniquely features the DriverFocus Distraction Mitigation System, which uses facial recognition to monitor for driver fatigue or distraction. The vehicle received high safety ratings, including a five-star overall rating from the NHTSA. Spacious and Comfortable Interior: Reviewers and owners consistently praise the roomy cabin, offering significant headroom and legroom for a compact SUV. The seats are described as very comfortable, even for long trips. Excellent Visibility: The Forester&#39;s design, with slim pillars and large glass areas, provides outstanding all-around visibility, a significant safety benefit and driver convenience. Standard All-Wheel Drive and Off-Road Capability: Subaru&#39;s Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive system is standard on all trims, not an optional extra as with many competitors. This, combined with 8.7 inches of ground clearance and X-Mode (standard on all but the base model), provides legitimate off-road capability for snow, dirt, and rough terrain. Generous Cargo Space: The vehicle offers a commodious 35.4 cubic feet of luggage space behind the rear seats (33.0 with the moonroof) and a maximum of 76.1 cubic feet with the rear seats folded, which is near the top of its class. It also features a wide rear gate opening for easy loading. High-End Amenities: As the top-of-the-line trim, the Touring comes with numerous premium features as standard, including: Perforated leather upholstery. Heated front and rear outboard seats. A heated steering wheel. An 8-inch infotainment system with navigation and a Harman Kardon premium audio system. Driver&#39;s seat and power mirror memory settings. Good Fuel Economy: The 2020 Forester is widely praised for its fuel efficiency, with an EPA-estimated 26 city/33 highway MPG, which is competitive among all-wheel-drive compact SUVs. Durability and Reliability: The Forester has a strong reputation for durability and is built on a new platform designed for crashworthiness, quietness, and agility. This versatile SUV is perfect for families or contractors with its oversized cargo area, exceptional horsepower and option upgrades. Why spend more money than you have to? This Subaru Forester will help you keep the extra money you&#39;d normally spend on gas. This AWD-equipped vehicle will handle beautifully on any terrain and in any weather condition your may find yourself in. The benefits of driving an all wheel drive vehicle, such as this Subaru Forester Touring, include superior acceleration, improved steering, and increased traction and stability. A Subaru with as few miles as this one is a rare find. This Forester Touring was gently driven and it shows. Added comfort with contemporary style is the leather interior to heighten the quality and craftsmanship for the Subaru Forester Touring. Performance, ease of use and efficiency are just a few reasons you&#39;ll love the navigation system that comes with this car.Accident or damage reported to Carfax<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",89,

And with the optional Weissach Package, this GT3 RS reaches another level of precision and it pushes the limits of what a naturally aspirated 911 can achieve. At its heart lies a 4.0-liter naturally aspirated flat-six engine, revving to a spine-tingling 9,000 rpm and producing 518 horsepower and 342 lb-ft of torque. Power in this GT3 RS is routed through a lightning-quick 7-speed PDK transmission. The result? 0-60 mph in just 3 seconds and a top speed of 184 mph. Aerodynamics play a starring role, with an aggressive rear diffuser and manually adjustable swan-neck rear wing that generate up to 150% more downforce than its predecessor. Agility is further enhanced by rear-axle steering and Porsche Active Suspension Management. From appearance alone, the GT3&#39;s wide body, center-lock wheels, and aggressive aero signal its intent without saying a word. Inside, this track-focused 911 remains modern and functional. Lightweight carbon bucket seats, Race-Tex trim throughout, and GT-specific driving modes provide a no-nonsense layout that keeps the focus firmly on driving. As with many Porsches, customization is key. This example features satin pyro red lightweight magnesium wheels, carbon fiber door sill guards, and a BOSE surround sound system. The 911 GT3 RS is more than just a road car. It&#39;s a precision tool for the track that&#39;s comfortable and refined enough to enjoy driving daily on the road.

The vehicle constantly monitors the roadway in front of the vehicle and identifies and tracks pedestrians on an interior display. If the system determines a likely impact, it will automatically take preventative steps to avoid hitting the pedestrian. With this system the driver's hands must remain on the wheel at all times but can be removed briefly (for a few seconds), otherwise the vehicle will prompt the driver to put their hands back on the wheel.Technology and Telematics Without the need for a manufacturer specific app to be installed on the smart device, the vehicle infotainment system can access and control functions of a smart device physically plugged-into the vehicle.SNOW WHITE PEARL, BLACK, WOVEN & TRICOT CLOTH SEAT TRIM, LX TECHNOLOGY PACKAGE, CARPETED FLOOR MATS Come on in to Cable Dahmer Kia of Lawrence today at 1225 E 23rd Street Lawrence KS 66046 or call 785-331-0016 to schedule a test drive!","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",184.5,

From a distance it reads like a sculpted predator poised at the edge of civility: broad haunches, flared wheel arches and a low, prowlike nose that suggests motion even when the engine is quiet. The SVRs exterior is all purposeful punctuationair intakes that look functional by conviction, a roofline that slopes like a coupes compromise, and quad exhaust outlets that insist on being noticed. Its an SUV with theatrical instincts, wearing performance details as if they were bespoke cufflinks.<br /><br />Slide into the cabin and the dual personality becomes tactile. The cockpit wraps you in a satisfying mix of luxury and restraint: deep, bolstered seats that bracket the driver, stitched leather and alcantara that invite touch, and carbon accents that whisper of track days without shouting. The controls are arranged with an almost clubby logicswitches and paddles that feel weighted and decisiveand the interiors palette balances warmth and purpose so that every surface rewards attention rather than glare.<br /><br />On the road the FPACE SVR is pure temperament translated into motion. Theres an immediacy to its responses that delights: steering with a direct, communicative edge, a chassis that resists theatrical body roll and instead channels momentum with composed aggression, and a ride that can soothe a boulevard or sharpen on a canyon run. Its not a blunt instrument, its a precise oneable to hustle down an onramp with theatrical urgency and then settle into a velvety, composed stride for long stretches. The driving experience feels intentionally cinematic: moments of visceral excitement punctuate long chapters of cultivated refinement.<br /><br />Sound design is part of the character. The exhaust doesnt merely announce acceleration, it performs, swelling with a low, throaty authority and occasionally popping like punctuation when the throttle is eased. Inside, the cabin balances that aural drama with isolation where conversation matters, creating a sense that the car knows when to sing and when to listen.<br /><br />Practical comforts are honest and consideredroom for passengers and luggage exists, but never as an afterthought. Technology and creature comforts integrate in service of the drive: helpful, present, and not insistent. In short, the 2021 FPACE SVR is a study in contrasts: sumptuous and savage, civilized and ready to pounce. Its for the driver who wants an SUV that behaves like a performance car most of the timeand like a showpiece every time the road invites a bit of mischief.<br />Recent Arrival! 2021 Jaguar F-PACE SVR Black 8-Speed Automatic AWD 5.0L V8 Supercharged **Here at Sawgrass INFINITI you&#39;ll receive the expertise of our Factory Certified Sales Consultants and staff.

Now you can own luxury without the luxury price tag!More information about the 2017 Chevrolet Tahoe:The Suburban and Tahoe are by far the best-selling models in their class, and they&#39;re tough rivals for the Ford Expedition, Toyota Sequoia and Nissan Armada, among others. These two Chevy models are closely related in most ways--although there&#39;s a key difference: the Suburban is 14 inches longer in wheelbase and 20 inches longer overall than the Tahoe, and that results in a significantly larger third-row seat than in the Tahoe--as well as easier access to it, and more cargo space. Compared to rival models, the Chevy Tahoe and Suburban stand out for their ride quality and relatively efficient engines. They&#39;re also very rugged and versatile, and can be outfitted for off-road toughness, tow ability and interior luxury as needed. Chevrolet claims that the Suburban will be the most fuel-efficient model in the full-size SUV class, thanks to tech such as direct injection and active fuel management (cylinder deactivation). Although the profile of the Suburban and Tahoe haven&#39;t changed all that much, Chevy has managed to make significant improvements to aerodynamics. Chiseled sheet metal and big, flamboyant wheels (up to 22 inches) help maintain a powerful look.Interesting features of this model are Much-improved interior, seating space, towing ability, versatility and toughness, comfortable, refined ride, and relatively fuel-efficient engines<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",150.25,

Here are the most special and unique aspects of the 296 GTB:1. The Revolutionary V6 Hybrid PowertrainThis is the most significant feature and a first for a mainline Ferrari model:First V6 for a Production Ferrari (Since the Dino): It&#39,s the first road car to wear the Ferrari badge that uses a V6 engine since the legendary Dino models of the 60s and 70s (which were marketed as a separate brand). The &quot,Hot-V&quot, Engine Design: The all-new twin-turbo V6 has its turbochargers mounted inside the &quot,V&quot, of the cylinder banks. This &quot,hot-vee&quot, configuration: Increases compactness and lowers the engine&#39,s center of gravity.Achieves a world-record-setting specific power output of hp per liter for a production car. Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) System: The V6 is paired with a rear-mounted electric motor (MGU-K) to deliver a massive combined output of 819 hp (830 cv), which is sent exclusively to the rear wheels. Electric-Only Driving: The PHEV system allows for a short electric-only range (around miles / km) at speeds up to mph, enabling silent running through urban &quot,zero-emission zones.&quot, 2. Aerodynamic Innovation &amp, DesignThe car&#39,s design is heavily influenced by aerodynamics and features a shorter wheelbase for enhanced agility: Active Downforce: Unlike previous Ferrari active aero systems that primarily managed drag, the 296 GTB uses a LaFerrari-inspired active rear spoiler that deploys to generate additional downforce (up to kg with the Assetto Fiorano package). Compact, Sculpted Design: The car has a shorter wheelbase than previous mid-rear-engined V8 Ferraris (like the F8 Tributo), which enhances its agility and gives it a highly compact, monolithic appearance. Tribute to the Past: Its simple, beautiful forms and side air intakes reference classic Ferraris, most notably the iconic 1963 250 LM race car.3. Focus on &quot,Fun to Drive&quot,Ferrari engineered the 296 GTB to deliver a highly engaging and usable driving experience, which they call &quot,fun-to-drive&quot,:New Dynamic Controls: It features a world-first 6-way Chassis Dynamic Sensor (6w-CDS), a new ABS evo controller, and electric power steering, all working together to improve handling and braking performance. Soundtrack of a V12: The V6 engine was meticulously tuned, earning the nickname &quot,piccolo V12&quot, (little V12), as its configuration and high rpm redline allow it to reproduce the pure, high-frequency notes of a naturally aspirated V12 engine.In short, the Ferrari 296 GTB is special because it is a PHEV V6 revolution that ushers in a new era of performance and technology for Ferrari while retaining and elevating the brand&#39,s core values of agility and driving emotion.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",190.5,

The Continental GT is offered as a two-door coupé or convertible, with four seats. It was the first new Bentley released after the company's acquisition by Volkswagen AG in 1998, and the first Bentley to employ mass production manufacturing techniques. The GT V8 version of the Continental GT has a twin-turbo 4-litre (3,993 cc) V8 engine (developed jointly with Audi) that produces 500 hp (373 kW) and 487 lb·ft (660 N·m) of torque. The car is capable of reaching a top speed of 192 mph (309 km/h). It also features cylinder deactivation technology that can deactivate half of the cylinders when they're not needed to improve fuel economy by up to 8%. Other changes, including on-demand steering assistance, weight reduction, better engine heat management, overrun alternator charging and eco-tyres, improve overall fuel consumption by 40% from the W12's 17.1 mpg to the V8's 26.1 mpg .

We rigorously research both local and national markets to ensure that every vehicle is priced fairly. Then we go a step further and place that One Low Price on the windshield of every vehicle. This provides our customers with a fair, up-front, and transparent purchasing experience.

Finished in timeless Alpine White over a Black leather interior with M accents, the M2&#39;s aggressive proportions, wide stance, and purposeful design are further enhanced by carbon fiber details and Shadowline trim, giving the car a clean yet unmistakably motorsport-inspired presence.At its core is BMW&#39;s renowned S58 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged inline-six, paired with a highly sought-after 6-speed manual gearbox. This setup delivers an engaging, driver-focused experience that modern performance cars rarely offer. Enhanced with the Dinan Experience Package installed in Summer 2025 by German Auto LTD, output is elevated to an impressive 537 horsepower and 513 lb-ft of torque (more HP than the new M2 CS), transforming the M2 into a truly formidable performer while retaining everyday drivability.The Dinan Experience Package is comprehensive and premium, featuring the Dinan&#43; PCU, gloss carbon fiber cold air intake, high-flow exhaust with mid pipe, carbon fiber strut tower brace, and Dinan pedal covers, over $12,000 in upgrades. Importantly, these enhancements are backed by a Dinan factory-matching 4-year/50,000-mile warranty, offering peace of mind alongside exhilarating performance. An upgraded oil cooler and vent grille set further support consistent performance under spirited driving conditions.Handling and grip are equally well addressed with lightweight Apex VS-5RS wheels wrapped in Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires, a combination that dramatically sharpens turn-in and maximizes traction. A STEK front-end paint protection film has been professionally installed to preserve the Alpine White finish, ensuring the car remains as striking as it is capable.Inside, the cabin blends modern technology with motorsport flair. Noteworthy factory options include the carbon fiber roof and interior trim, Shadowline and Lighting Packages, heated steering wheel, parking assistant, wireless device charging, and Live Cockpit Professional with heads-up display. Every detail reinforces the M2&#39;s dual nature as both a serious performance machine and a refined daily driver.With just 13,000 miles, this M2 has been meticulously maintained, always serviced at a BMW dealer or respected German automotive specialist. It is a non-smoker vehicle with no accidents and a clean title, complete with both keys, all service records, books, window sticker, and all original f","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",128.5,

Modifications reported by the seller are limited to a GRP titanium exhaust system and tinted windows. Lotus introduced the Emira in 2021 as the replacement for the outgoing Evora. The Emira represents a leap forward in terms of technology, notably, this is Lotus' first vehicle to include optional active safety features such as adaptive cruise control, automated emergency braking, and lane departure warning. The Toyota-sourced supercharged V6 was carried over from the Evora, and is still offered with a 6-speed manual transmission. Power comes from a Toyota-derived 3.5-liter supercharged V6, rated at 400 horsepower and 310 lb-ft of torque. Output is sent to the rear wheels via a 6-speed manual transmission.

This 2020 Chevrolet Corvette Stingray 3LT is an embodiment of pure American muscle and exotic-car performance designed to take on the head honchos from overseas. Power comes from a mid-mounted 6.2L naturally aspirated LT2 V8 making 495 hp and 465 lb-ft of torque directed through an 8-speed dual clutch transmission. The result comes in the form of a 0-60 mph time of just 2.9 seconds. Visually, the Stingray commands attention with its sharp aerodynamic lines, wide stance, and aggressive air intakes. This Torch Red example is spec&#39;d with the Z51 Performance Package and Magnetic Ride Control for increased performance and power. With its removable roof panel, it transforms into an open-air driving experience in seconds. The 3LT package elevates the Stingray&#39;s cabin into a luxury experience, featuring Adrenaline Red leather seating surfaces, heated/ventilated GT2 bucket seats, and contrast stitching throughout.

Originally debuting for the 2019 model year, the 8-Series comes as a coupe and convertible, plus a four-door Gran Coupe. As you'd expect, the M8 comes with plenty of power, performance and character. This particular 2020 BMW M8 Competition is no different,If you want something close to a supercar but with signature BMW luxury, this car is the ticket.This 2020 BMW M8 Competition is cloaked in Alpine White, a stunning shade that brings out its beautiful design. The car rides on an intricate set of 20-inch alloy wheels in gunmetal gray, behind which lurk blue M brake calipers. The tires on this car are high-performance Michelin Pilot Sport units. At the front, you've got glaring LED headlamps, while the rear LED taillamps leave their mark as you drive by. The quad exhaust tips are another M-division hallmark, as they allow the turbocharged V8 to emit a distinctive roar. Inside, there's a lovely Sakhir Orange and Black four-seat cabin waiting to be enjoyed. The front seats are heated and power-adjustable units, while the rear seats offer surprising amounts of head and legroom for what is, in effect, a two-door coupe. There's a Bowers & Wilkins upgraded sound system, Apple CarPlay, and Android Auto for infotainment needs. It's all controlled via BMW's slick iDrive interface, which can be accessed via a rotary controller in the center console, as well as the touchscreen on the dash. There's dual-zone climate control to keep everyone comfortable and the obligatory features of power windows, mirrors, and door locks. The driver gets a multifunction steering wheel and gazes at a customizable digital instrument cluster. Gear shift paddles are present, too, as well as two smaller red 'M' paddles for accessing special modes. Look closer, and you'll even spot child seat anchors in the rear seats of this 2020 BMW M8 Competition. That, coupled with its amazingly accommodating trunk, makes it a practical car. As practical as it may be, this 2020 BMW M8 Competition has a superb 4.4L twin-turbocharged V8 under the hood, just waiting to be woken up.

In a world moving away from true driver engagement, the manual M2 stands out as one of the most exciting performance cars you can still buy.<br /><br />This is a CARFAX One-Owner vehicle with a Clean CARFAX, representing the type of well-kept example serious buyers want.<br /><br />What truly sets this M2 apart is the rare and highly sought-after M Carbon Bucket Seats. These are not just an interior option, they are a statement. Built for maximum support and weight reduction, the carbon buckets completely transform the driving experience and give the cabin a true motorsport feel. Cars equipped with these seats are significantly harder to find and are always at the top of the list for serious M enthusiasts.<br /><br />Adding to the performance-focused spec is the M Carbon Roof, lowering the center of gravity while giving the car an aggressive, high-end look that will age beautifully over time.<br /><br />This M2 has also been exceptionally cared for cosmetically. The vehicle was fully cut and buffed, and two layers of professional ceramic coating were applied less than 4,000 miles ago, giving the paint an incredible finish and added long-term protection.<br /><br />Other standout features include:<br /><br />6-Speed Manual Transmission<br />Rear-Wheel Drive Performance<br />M Carbon Bucket Seats<br />M Carbon Roof<br />harman/kardon Premium Surround Sound<br />Merino Leather Upholstery<br />Navigation with Widescreen Display<br />Adaptive Suspension<br />Heated Front Seats<br />Staggered 19-inch front and 20-inch rear wheels<br /><br />The reality is simple: manual M cars with carbon buckets do not last long.

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Meet your ultimate co-pilot, GPS linked cruise control.</li><li> Distance pacing cruise control - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with Distance pacing cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and the vehicle ahead. Distance pacing cruise control, your ultimate co-pilot.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Rear camera - Watching your back! The rear camera helps you see obstacles and hazards you otherwise couldn&#39;t by showing enhanced images of what is behind you. The rear camera is an extra set of eyes that&#39;s both convenient and safe.</li><li> Rear collision mitigation - It has your back. Rear collision mitigation uses sensors to monitor the area behind you. If it senses an impending crash, it activates certain features to help prevent a collision or reduce the severity of it. Put your worries behind you with rear collision mitigation.</li><li> Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane.

Predictive brake assist monitors the available distance in front of you compared to your vehicles speed. If your speed exceeds the required distance to stop short of a collision, it readies your brakes to apply maximum stopping force when you use them. Predictive brake assist helps see to it that you stop.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> SYNC 4 AppLink/Apple CarPlay/Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring</li><li> Mobile hotspot - WiFi on the fly.

It?s a Southern car since new, clean Carfax, and garage kept, so it shows the kind of care you hope to find but rarely do. With only 9,700 miles, it still feels tight and fresh. Under the hood is the 6.2L LS3 V8 (436 hp) paired with a 6-speed automatic and a 2.73 rear axle ratio. It pulls hard when you ask, then settles down for an easy cruise. The Z51 Performance Package and Dual Mode Performance Exhaust give it that sharp, planted feel, with a sound that wakes up when you lean in. The 5-spoke forged chrome wheels finish the stance just right. Inside, the 3LT trim brings the upscale touch. Cashmere leather, heated power seats, driver memory, and a Heads Up Display keep it comfortable and focused. Dual-zone climate control, Bose audio, navigation, Bluetooth for phone, and XM Radio make it an easy car to live with. You also get keyless entry, universal home remote, cruise control, OnStar, fog lights, and steering-wheel controls. A low-mile, well-kept C6 in a standout color, and ready for the next garage.

More information about the 2015 GMC Sierra 1500: The 2015 GMC Sierra 1500 lineup comprises a set of pickups aimed at a wide range of uses, from personal transportation to purpose-built tow rigs, farm or ranch haulers, or off-road machines. With three cab styles, two bed lengths, three engines, 2-wheel and 4-wheel drive versions, and various trim levels from spartan to lavish, the Sierra lineup offers something for all. Top-of-the-line Denali models remain the choice of more discerning truck shoppers, with luxurious interiors and the full set of features of a premium SUV. The Sierra is a quiet truck, thanks to a host of sound-deadening additions like triple-sealed doors and aerodynamic measures. The Sierra&#39;s refined engines are strong yet fuel-efficient. GM boasts that models with the V6 have towing ratings of up to 7,600 pounds, which is hundreds of pounds more than a comparable Ford F-150 or Ram 1500. Also, the Sierra 1500 might have some of the lowest maintenance costs among pickups because of its 4-wheel disc brakes with Duralife rotors, which GM claims will last twice as long as conventional brake rotors. This model sets itself apart with innovative cargo solutions, upgraded connectivity and entertainment systems, quiet, stylish cabins, and Strong, efficient engines<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",120.5,

Past Chairman of the Board and CEO John Wiesner was born in Richmond, Texas and grew up in Hempstead. He married Beth Sorsby, also of Hempstead. They were graduates of Southern Methodist University. Mr. Wiesner started his automotive career in Hempstead in 1949, then moved to Baytown. In 1977, he purchased the Buick-Pontiac-GMC dealership in Conroe which is now the main headquarters for the Wiesner Automotive Group.

It gives this Camaro that unmistakable performance silhouette that turns heads at every stoplight.

With 68,684 miles, this FR-S has been well cared for and retains the sharp handling and engaging driving experience that made the platform so popular among enthusiasts. Its clean lines, balanced proportions, and low-slung stance give it a timeless, purpose-built look.<br /><br />The Monogram trim adds premium touches to the black interior, elevating the cabin with upgraded materials and features while still keeping the focus on the driver. The interior remains sporty and functional, offering supportive seating and a simple, intuitive layout that emphasizes connection to the road. Included with the car are the original window sticker and owner&#39;s manuals, further highlighting its well-documented, single-owner history.<br /><br />What truly sets this FR-S apart is its unique setup. A 2-inch lift combined with 17-inch Method wheels wrapped in 235/55 Hankook tires gives the car a distinctive rally-inspired presence while adding extra versatility and road confidence. This setup not only makes the car visually striking but also opens the door for light off-road or all-weather fun, setting it apart from typical FR-S builds.<br /><br />If you&#39;re looking for an FR-S that blends proven sports car dynamics with a unique and adventurous twist, this 2014 Scion FR-S Monogram delivers.

This Chevrolet Camaro SS has a showroom quality finish with no dents or scratches visible. This hard-to-find gem is an exquisite example of meticulous attention to detail and rich refinements. More information about the 2015 Chevrolet Camaro: The Chevrolet Camaro is a modern take on GM&#39;s legendary muscle-car, offering strong rear-wheel-drive performance in a low coupe or convertible body style. Relative to the other pony cars like the Ford Mustang or Dodge Challenger, the Camaro performs athletically, although it gives up some outward visibility for the chunky, bold design. The performance standout of the model line remains the Camaro SS Coupe. Camaro Convertibles are a strong value as well and provide a different sort of fun. Some drivers wanting performance approaching that of high-end exotics, will be tempted by the ZL1 which provides outrageous horsepower numbers.
