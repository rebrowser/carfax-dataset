Check out the following:\n\n\nOne Owner! \n\nCity 36/Hwy 36\n\n\n\n \n\nRUBY FLARE PEARL\n\nSafety and Security<ul><li> Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane. Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.</li><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li></ul>\n\n Our certification process keeps you in mind every step of the way.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety.

The 2025 Mazda CX-70 PHEV Premium Package answers with Hiroshima innovation—a turbocharged 2.5-liter engine paired with electric motors unleashing 323 combined horsepower through intelligent all-wheel drive, 26 miles of pure electric range eliminating gas stations for daily commutes, Premium Plus package wrapping occupants in Nappa leather luxury, Bose premium audio transforming acoustics into concert experiences, and that Kodo &#34;Soul of Motion&#34; design philosophy proving electrification doesn&#39;t require sacrificing driving engagement. This isn&#39;t another compromised hybrid appliance or overpriced German complexity, it&#39;s Mazda&#39;s boldest statement proving two-row luxury meets electrified intelligence—where 10-way power memory seats find your position automatically, panoramic moonroof bathes premium materials in natural light, 360-degree camera conquers tight spaces confidently, and that winged badge confirms you&#39;ve discovered what happens when engineers obsessed with Jinba Ittai build their electrified flagship.<br /><br />Critical Acclaim: The CX-70 represents Mazda&#39;s ambitious leap into electrified two-row luxury. Car and Driver praises &#34;sports car dynamics meeting PHEV efficiency,&#34; while MotorTrend celebrates &#34;the plug-in hybrid that actually rewards driving enthusiasts.&#34; Early owners rave: &#34;electric torque transforms city driving,&#34; &#34;interior rivals luxury Germans,&#34; and &#34;Premium Package justifies every penny.&#34; This is validation from driving purists, sustainability-minded families, and professionals who discovered Mazda&#39;s PHEV delivers genuine performance without range anxiety or environmental guilt.<br /><br />The exterior broadcasts sophisticated presence—signature wing grille commanding attention, LED headlights with adaptive lighting scripting Mazda&#39;s evolution, sculpted bodywork suggesting motion through Japanese landscapes, fastback roofline adding coupe-like elegance to SUV practicality, and 20-inch dark-finish alloy wheels balancing athleticism with refinement. The longer wheelbase versus CX-5 creates commanding stance and exceptional rear legroom. Machine Gray Metallic or Soul Red Crystal Metallic paint (additional cost, hand-applied by Takumi masters) showcases Japanese craftsmanship aging beautifully—this design transcends trends.<br /><br />PHEV Powerhouse: The plug-in hybrid system demonstrates electrified excellence—323 combined horsepower merging 2.5-liter turbocharged engine with electric motors, instant electric torque creating exhilarating acceleration from stops, 26 miles of EPA-estimated all-electric range (perfect for daily commutes eliminating gas consumption entirely), 17.8 kWh battery charging fully in approximately 3 hours on 240V, and seamless transitions between electric/hybrid modes you&#39;ll barely notice. Zero-to-60 happens in approximately 5.8 seconds—seriously quick for electrified luxury. Combined fuel economy delivers approximately 56 MPGe when maximizing electric range—impressive for 4,400 pounds of premium SUV.<br /><br />i-ACTIV AWD Intelligence: Mazda&#39;s predictive all-wheel drive monitors 27 parameters—outside temperature, wiper activity, throttle inputs, steering angle, road conditions—distributing torque before you need it. Combined with G-Vectoring Control Plus (adjusting power delivery and braking through corners) and Kinematic Posture Control (using brake inputs to reduce body roll), the CX-70 delivers that horse-and-rider connection Mazda engineers obsess over. This isn&#39;t electrified transportation, it&#39;s electrified driving pleasure.<br /><br />Premium Package Luxury: Enter and experience Japanese artistry elevated—Nappa leather seating with contrast stitching throughout, heated and ventilated front seats conquering seasonal extremes, 10-way power driver&#39;s seat with memory, heated steering wheel wrapped in premium leather, genuine wood trim (not plastic imposters), brushed satin chrome accents, and ambient lighting creating sanctuary atmospheres. Build quality rivals luxury marquees—every surface rewards touch, materials age gracefully, assembly tolerances satisfy perfectionists. That new-car aroma blends premium leather, natural wood, and Japanese attention to detail normally reserved for six-figure luxury.<br /><br />Technology Harmony: The 12.3-inch center display integrates connectivity seamlessly—wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, wireless smartphone charging pad, voice recognition understanding naturally, and navigation guiding intelligently. The 12.3-inch digital driver display presents information clearly with customizable layouts. Head-up display projects essential data onto windshield keeping eyes forward. The Bose premium audio system (12 speakers including subwoofer) delivers impressive acoustics—concerts sound live, podcasts achieve NPR clarity, and perfectly tuned bass resonates without booming.<br /><br />Two-Row Sanctuary: Rear passengers enjoy class-leading space—adult-friendly legroom rivaling three-row competitors, supportive seating wrapped in premium materials, individual climate vents, heated outboard seats, and dedicated USB-C charging ports. The longer wheelbase creates lounge-like comfort previously impossible in two-row packaging. The 29.1 cubic-foot cargo area (56.3 with rear seats folded) accommodates weekend adventures, electric bike gear, or spontaneous antique discoveries. Power liftgate opens with foot-activated sensor.<br /><br />i-ACTIVSENSE Safety: Standard technologies include radar cruise control with stop-and-go capability, lane departure warning with lane-keep assist, blind-spot monitoring with rear cross-traffic alert, smart brake support (automatic emergency braking), traffic sign recognition, and driver attention alert. The 360-degree camera with front/rear parking sensors provides bird&#39;s-eye confidence. Mazda&#39;s commitment to safety protects occupants obsessively while maintaining driving engagement.<br /><br />Electrified Convenience: Charge port illumination aids nighttime charging, scheduled charging optimizes off-peak electricity rates, remote climate pre-conditioning uses wall power rather than battery charge, and multiple drive modes (Normal, Sport, EV) adapt personality instantly. Monitor charging status, battery range, and energy flow through smartphone app or dashboard displays.<br /><br />Key Features: • 2.5L Turbo &#43; Electric Motors PHEV (323 HP Combined) • 26 Miles All-Electric Range • 56 MPGe Combined (Estimated) • 17.8 kWh Battery (3-Hour Charge on 240V) • i-ACTIV AWD with Predictive Intelligence • G-Vectoring Control Plus • Kinematic Posture Control • Premium Plus Package with Nappa Leather • Heated &amp; Ventilated Front Seats • 10-Way Power Driver&#39;s Seat with Memory • Heated Steering Wheel • Genuine Wood Trim &amp; Ambient Lighting • 12.3-Inch Center Display • 12.3-Inch Digital Driver Display • Wireless Apple CarPlay/Android Auto • Wireless Charging Pad • Head-Up Display • Bose Premium Audio (12 Speakers) • Panoramic Moonroof • 360-Degree Camera with Parking Sensors • Adaptive LED Headlights • Radar Cruise with Stop-and-Go • Heated Rear Seats • Power Liftgate with Hands-Free Access • 20-Inch Dark-Finish Alloy Wheels<br /><br />Mazda Excellence: Japanese engineering means reliability transcending expectations.

Weighing approximately 5300 pounds, the GTC W12 combines effortless long distance cruising with dynamic capability, aided by adaptive air suspension and all wheel steering for confident handling and a smooth ride. Inside, the cabin is luxuriously appointed with hand stitched leather, heated and ventilated seats, premium audio and advanced infotainment, while the convertible soft top opens quickly to offer open air motoring. This low mileage example represents the consummate blend of performance, craftsmanship and everyday usability that defines Bentley&#39;s flagship convertible.\n\n\n<b>Why BUY from Naples Motorsports Inc.?</b>\n\nWhen you choose this <b>Glacier White 2018 Bentley Continental GT</b> with <b>25,597</b> miles, you are not just buying a used vehicle - you are investing in quality, reliability and peace of mind. Our clientele depend on us for <b>Transparent Pricing, Convenience</b> and, most importantly, <b>Customer FIRST Service!</b>\n\nNo Accidents! \n\n\n \n<b>What this vehicle includes:</b>\n\n\n\n\n\nConvenience<ul><li> Cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful, until cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed using the steering wheel mounted controls and it will maintain that speed without driver intervention. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Resting your right foot is right at your fingertips thanks to cruise control with steering wheel mounted controls.</li><li> Power close trunk/liftgate - Dump the slam. You&#39;re done loading up, now don&#39;t subject your passengers to the ear splitting sound of you slamming the back shut. All you have to do is hit the button and the power close trunk/liftgate takes care of the rest. You can walk away as the Power close trunk/liftgate gently closes and latches.</li><li> Power open and close trunk - On-demand access. When your arms are full of cargo, the last thing you want to do is set it all down just to open the trunk, then pick it all back up to load it in. By remotely opening and closing, power trunk lets you skip straight to the loading. Then you can walk away as it gently closes and latches. Load and go with power open and close trunk.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Brake assist - Stop right there. Something jumps out into the middle of the road and you need to stop now! With brake assist, you will. It uses the speed of the brake pedal&#39;s travel to sense panic braking, then applies all available power to boost your stopping power. Brake assist can stop the accident before it is one.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car. You can control your device through your vehicle&#39;s infotainment system. Smart device mirroring brings together safety and convenience by making it easier to find what you&#39;re looking for while keeping your eyes on the road.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n \nCome on in to <b>Naples Motorsports Inc.</b> today at <b>1250 Airport-Pulling Rd S Naples FL 34104</b> or call <b>(239) 430-5655</b> to schedule a test drive! \n\n","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",89.15,

Carbon-ceramic brakes provide exceptional stopping power and confidence.<br /><br />The retractable hardtop operates seamlessly, preserving the coupes lines when closed and transforming the driving experience when lowered. With the roof down, the car delivers an immersive connection to the engine and surroundings, making the 488 Spider as thrilling on a scenic drive as it is capable on a winding road.<br /><br />Inside, the cockpit is purpose-built yet refined, featuring leather-trimmed sport bucket seats, a leather-wrapped sport steering wheel, dual-zone automatic climate control, and Ferraris infotainment system with navigation and Apple CarPlay. Premium touches such as Harman/Kardon audio, rain-sensing wipers, headlight cleaning system, and integrated rollover protection enhance both comfort and safety.<br /><br />Additional highlights include rear parking sensors, adaptive suspension, power seats and windows, speed-sensitive steering, and staggered 20-inch alloy wheels that emphasize the cars low, aggressive stance.<br /><br />The 488 Spider represents a pivotal moment in Ferraris lineage, combining turbocharged performance with classic Ferrari design and open-air excitement. It remains one of the most engaging and emotionally compelling modern Ferraris, offering supercar performance without compromise and an ownership experience defined by drama, precision, and unmistakable presence.<br /><br /><br />Clean CARFAX.<br /><br /><br />Plus government fees and taxes, any finance charges, any dealer document processing charge, any electronic filing charge, and any emission testing charge.
