Tastefully but mildly modifiedMillennium Yellow!If you’re looking for a pure, no-nonsense driver’s car, this is it. The 2004 Z06 represents the final year of the C5 Z06 and one of the most analog, raw performance Corvettes ever built. No turbos, no gimmicks—just a high-revving LS6, a 6-speed manual, and a chassis that talks to you every second you’re behind the wheel.Finished in iconic Millennium Yellow over black leather, this example has just over 31k miles and has been well maintained, garage kept, and carefully upgraded to enhance the driving experience without compromising its character.Performance & Upgrades Cold Air Intake – improved throttle response and induction sound Long Tube Headers – adds power and that unmistakable Z06 growl BC Racing Adjustable Coilover Suspension – tight, planted, and tunable for street or spirited driving Paint Corrected & Ceramic Coated – deep gloss and long-lasting protectionRecent ServiceFresh oil changeBrand new tiresFull inspection completedWhy the C5 Z06 MattersThe C5 Z06 is already a modern classic—and the 2004 model year is especially desirable as the last of the truly analog, lightweight, high-revving Z06s before electronics and refinement softened the edge. The LS6 is legendary for its reliability and character, and the driving experience is raw, mechanical, and engaging in a way newer cars simply can’t replicate.This car delivers:Unfiltered steering feelMassive grip and balanceA motor that begs to be revvedA connected, visceral driving experience every time you get inFuture CollectibilityLow-mile, clean, well-kept C5 Z06s—especially in standout colors like Millennium Yellow—are becoming harder to find.

Finished in Black over Black, this Vette has serious money invested into it, and it shows from every angle. Let’s be real — you gotta love when a black-on-black Corvette shows up done right. This car looks mean, sounds mean, and drives mean. It starts with the aggressive F1-style rear spoiler, sits perfectly on black OEM Corvette wheels with a chrome lip, and features a Stingray raised-style hood that gives it an even more intimidating presence. Inside, the cabin has been dressed up with red carbon fiber accent pieces, giving it that performance-inspired look, along with an upgraded Kenwood navigation head unit for modern usability. Performance-wise, this Corvette is no joke. It’s been upgraded with a FAST Intakes manifold, upgraded headers, cold air intake, and a full upgraded exhaust system — the result is a car that absolutely comes alive when you hit the throttle. This thing sounds incredible and delivers exactly the kind of raw LS experience enthusiasts want. Here’s the kicker — you’re getting all of this for under $20,000. Try building a C6 like this today and see how fast that budget disappears. Between the appearance mods and performance upgrades alone, you couldn’t replicate this car for anywhere near the asking price. This is a ton of car for the money and exactly the kind of fun, street-ready performance machine we love offering. If you’re looking for a Corvette with attitude that won’t break the bank — this is it. What else can you get like this for under $20K? Exactly. This one will sell quick. Come see it in our indoor 20,000 Sq Ft showroom at Apex AutoSports in Dallas, TX surrounded by 150+ other Performance, Modified & Collector Cars.

This is the desirable factory supercharged SS model, powered by GM’s legendary 3.8L L67 V6 with Eaton M90 supercharger, paired with a smooth 4-speed automatic transmission, delivering that unmistakable factory-blown performance with everyday drivability. This Monte Carlo is loaded with options, including the power moonroof and the Dale Earnhardt Jr. package, and it presents exactly the way you’d expect a true 1,133-mile time capsule to—tight, clean, and beautifully preserved. Even better, it comes with a clean, accident-free Carfax history and the complete collector package: original window sticker, books, keys, remotes, and original floor mats—the kind of full documentation that almost never stays together, especially on cars with mileage this low. While there’s no official registry that can tell us exactly how many remain with miles anywhere near this, examples like this simply don’t surface often. This is top-of-the-food-chain territory for a Supercharged DEJ Signature Series—an outstanding opportunity for the collector who wants originality, documentation, and ultra-low miles all in one package.

Look no further, you have found exactly what you&#39;ve been looking for. More information about the 2014 Chevrolet Camaro: The Chevrolet Camaro is a modern take on GM&#39;s legendary muscle-car, offering strong rear-wheel-drive performance in a low coupe or convertible body style. Relative to the other pony cars like the Ford Mustang or Dodge Challenger, the Camaro performs athletically, although it gives up some outward visibility for the chunky, bold design. The performance standout of the model line remains the Camaro SS Coupe. Camaro Convertibles are a strong value as well and provide a different sort of fun. Some drivers wanting performance approaching that of high-end exotics, the ZL1 provides outrageous horsepower numbers. While pricy among Camaros, it&#39;s faster than cars costing two or three times as much. Strengths of this model include daring design inside and out, muscle-car look and feel, Strong acceleration, great handling, and good highway efficiency<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",137.5,

Finished in Red Hot, it makes a bold first impression, made even more aggressive by the Black Rally Stripe Package that underscores its muscle-bound stance and performance DNA. At the heart of the experience is the legendary 6.2L V8, paired with a manual transmission that puts full control in the driver s hands. The 3.45 rear axle ratio sharpens throttle response, while the performance short-throw shifter delivers crisp, mechanical gear changes that make every shift feel deliberate and rewarding. Inside, the cabin keeps things focused and authentic with black sport cloth seating and a driver-oriented layout. Modern convenience is blended in seamlessly with the 7-inch touchscreen navigation system, while the Rear Vision Package including rearview camera and rear park assist adds confidence when maneuvering without dulling the car s raw edge. The power sunroof opens the cabin to the sound of the V8, turning every drive into an event. This Camaro SS isn t just about straight-line power it s about connection, sound, and control. With a manual gearbox and classic SS attitude, it delivers the kind of engaging, old-school muscle car experience that s becoming harder and harder to find.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",105.4,

Powered by a supercharged 6.2-liter LSA V8 engine mated to a six-speed automatic transmission, this machine originally produced 556 horsepower and 551 lb-ft of torque, which the rear wheels put to the pavement.

This CTS-V Wagon sits on black-finished 17” CCW Classic beadlocks wrapped in Mickey Thompson ET Street R tires and is wrapped in matte black, a dark hue that makes this car look even more menacing. The interior is no less special than the rest of the car. Heated and ventilated leather sport seats deliver optimal support and comfort to the driver and passenger, and features like selectable drive modes, multi-zone climate controls, wood grain interior trim pieces, a dash-mounted clock, and keyless ignition only heighten the overall cockpit experience.

It’s rugged, confident, and purpose-built for adventure, while still being comfortable enough to handle everyday life without feeling like a compromise.<br /><br />On the road, the Outback Wilderness feels planted and sure-footed, with a suspension setup designed to handle rougher terrain without beating you up on the highway. When conditions get less than ideal—snow, dirt, gravel, or mud—this Subaru really shines, delivering the kind of confidence that encourages you to keep going instead of playing it safe.<br /><br />Inside, the gray leather interior strikes a great balance between durability and comfort. It’s designed to handle active lifestyles while still feeling refined, with a layout that’s intuitive and driver-focused. Everything feels thoughtfully placed, making long drives and off-grid weekends equally enjoyable.<br /><br />Later in the story, the look ties it all together. Crystal White Pearl gives this Outback a clean, sharp appearance that contrasts perfectly with the Wilderness trim’s aggressive styling cues. A clean, no-accident history adds extra peace of mind to a vehicle that’s already built with confidence in mind.<br /><br />As an Archibald’s Certified vehicle, this Outback has passed a rigorous multi-point inspection, received full interior and exterior reconditioning, and comes with a 3-month or 3,000-mile limited warranty for added confidence. And when you buy from Archibald’s, you’re choosing an award-winning, family-owned dealership serving the Tri-Cities since 2001, known for top ratings and exceptional care. This Outback Wilderness isn’t just ready for adventure—it’s waiting for it.<br /><br /><br />A negotiable documentary service fee of $200.00 may apply to each purchase.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",80.75,

These vehicles are offered on a first come, first served basis and are subject to prior sale. It should be understood that the displayed vehicles are a sampling of what may be available, not every vehicle will be continuously available at all times for every consumer, and additional similar vehicles may be available but not yet posted. Due to the high demand for our individually selected vehicle inventory, there may be times when an individual vehicle is no longer available at the time you arrive at the dealership. This may occur due to a time delay between posting the vehicle, its actual sale and delivery, and its removal from the website. Posting, sale, and delivery of all pre-owned vehicles is an evolving process, and occasionally displayed vehicles may not be available for a variety of reasons, including prior sale, removal or transport to another location, or awaiting title and ownership confirmation. To better ensure a specific vehicle&#39;s availability, please contact the dealership to confirm its current status.

ONLY 31,200 MILES!!! LOADED!!! LANE DEPARURE WARNING!!! HEATED AND DUAL POWER SEATS!!! POWER MOONROFF!!! AND MUCH MORE!!! PLEASE HURRY!!! WILL NOT LAST LONG!!!Toyota's Highlander is one of the most well-known three-row midsize SUVs around. It's a great choice for growing families and offers versatility similar to a minivan but is more enjoyable to drive and easier to maneuver in most cases. The 2023 Highlander is based on the most recent generation Highlander that debuted in 2020 and receives some updates this year.Continue reading Edmunds Expert Rating below How does the Highlander drive? The latest Highlander has a turbocharged four-cylinder engine instead of the long-running V6. Well, color us impressed because we don't miss the V6. The four-cylinder makes plenty of torque at low rpm, and that helps make the Highlander pleasant to drive around town. At the Edmunds test track, our all-wheel-drive Highlander accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 7.4 seconds, which is a bit quicker than most V6-equipped three-row midsize SUVs.The Highlander's ability to stop quickly and confidently as well as negotiate a twisty road is solid. Body roll is controlled as you go around turns, and the available torque-vectoring AWD system also helps by applying engine power to individual rear wheels to subtly enhance the SUV's handling balance.

As the entry-level trim in the Impreza lineup, the 2.0i offers a no-frills approach to daily transportation but still includes the essential features modern drivers expect. Available in both sedan and hatchback body styles, it appeals to budget-conscious buyers who want a capable vehicle that performs well in all weather conditions.Under the hood, the 2016 Impreza 2.0i is powered by a 2.0-liter horizontally opposed (Boxer) 4-cylinder engine producing 148 horsepower and 145 lb-ft of torque. While not a performance powerhouse, the engine provides adequate acceleration for city and highway driving. It comes standard with a 5-speed manual transmission, while a CVT (continuously variable transmission) is available and more commonly found. The key advantage of the Impreza is its symmetrical all-wheel drive, which delivers enhanced grip and stability, especially in wet or snowy conditions—a rare feature in this segment and a major selling point.The interior is functional and well-organized, with straightforward controls and good outward visibility. While materials are more utilitarian than upscale, build quality is solid. The cabin offers ample headroom and legroom for both front and rear passengers, and the hatchback version adds even more cargo versatility. Ride comfort is commendable, with a suspension tuned more for comfort than sportiness, making it a smooth and quiet companion for commuting or longer trips.In terms of technology and features, the base 2.0i trim includes a decent range of equipment for the price. The standard touchscreen infotainment system is easy to use and includes Bluetooth connectivity and smartphone integration via USB. Subaru focused heavily on safety with the 2016 model, and even the base trim benefits from its strong safety ratings and stable handling. Though it lacks some of the upscale features and finishes found in higher trims, the 2.0i delivers exceptional value for those prioritizing safety, capability, and all-weather performance.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Smart device mirroring - Smartphone, meet smart car.

This Audi A7 3.0 Premium Plus features a navigation system that will free you of these unnecessary headaches. More information about the 2016 Audi A7: From a design standpoint, the Audi A7 is a standout in the market, while competitors such as the BMW 5-Series GranTurismo come close, the A7 is the least SUV in this segment. Inside, the A7 is a paragon of great design, as its cabin feels lush and detailed without being functionally complex. Even so, the A7 is very roomy, with enough space for adults in back. Technologically, the A7 is also near the head of its class.

It offers the ruggedness of an SUV with the comfort and drivability of a car, thanks to its raised ground clearance and standard all-wheel drive. In the Limited trim, the Outback leans further into refinement, delivering a premium interior, a quiet cabin, and a host of technology and safety features that enhance both convenience and peace of mind.Powering the 2.5i Limited is a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine producing 175 horsepower and 174 lb-ft of torque, mated to a continuously variable transmission (CVT). While not the fastest in its class, the powertrain provides adequate acceleration and shines in fuel efficiency, with EPA ratings of up to 25 mpg city and 32 mpg highway. Subaru’s symmetrical all-wheel drive system ensures confident traction in various road conditions, whether navigating snowy streets or gravel trails. The Outback’s ride is composed and comfortable, with responsive steering and a suspension setup that absorbs road imperfections with ease.Inside, the 2.5i Limited offers a surprisingly upscale experience. The cabin features high-quality materials, including leather-trimmed upholstery and soft-touch surfaces. Both front and rear passengers benefit from spacious, supportive seating, and the heated rear seats add a welcome touch of luxury for those in the back. The power-adjustable front seats, with driver-side memory settings, provide excellent comfort for longer drives. Subaru also equipped this trim with an upgraded infotainment system featuring a 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, Bluetooth, HD Radio, and smartphone integration. The system is user-friendly, and the available Harman Kardon premium audio system provides rich sound quality.Safety is another strong suit for the 2017 Outback 2.5i Limited. Subaru’s EyeSight Driver Assist Technology was available as an option and includes adaptive cruise control, pre-collision braking, lane departure warning, and lane keep assist. Even without EyeSight, the Limited trim includes blind-spot detection with rear cross-traffic alert and a rearview camera as standard, making it one of the safest choices in its class.Practicality is where the Outback continues to dominate. Its wagon-like body provides ample interior room and exceptional cargo capacity—up to 73.3 cubic feet with the rear seats folded. The wide-opening rear hatch and low load floor make it easy to haul gear, groceries, or luggage, and the standard roof rails with integrated crossbars add to its utility.Overall, the 2017 Subaru Outback 2.5i Limited is an excellent all-purpose vehicle for drivers who need comfort, capability, and safety in one smartly designed package. It combines everyday usability with rugged confidence and a touch of luxury, making it a perennial favorite among active families and outdoor enthusiasts alike.

This car is nearly new, inside and out, and needs nothing more than a new home. Not to mention, who has a better reputation for reliability and durability than Subaru? Economical to drive, economical to own! This one has many miles left in it, and it’s priced to fit pretty much any budget. Don’t wait…this car is so nice, we don’t expect it to be here very long!
