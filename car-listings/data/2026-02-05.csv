In either case, the manufacturer must file a public report describing the safety-related defect or noncompliance with a Federal motor vehicle safety standard, the involved vehicle/equipment population, the major events that resulted in the recall determination, a description of the remedy, and a schedule for the recall. NHTSA monitors each safety recall to ensure the manufacturers provide owners safe, free, and effective remedies according to the Safety Act and Federal regulations. Manufacturers are obligated to attempt to notify owners of recalled products. For vehicles, that means manufacturers merge their own records of vehicle purchasers with current state vehicle registration information. For equipment, where state registration records do not exist, manufacturers are obligated to notify their distribution chain and known purchasers of the recalled equipment. However, even if you do not receive a notification, if your vehicle, child restraint, or other item of equipment is involved in a safety recall, the manufacturer is obligated to provide a free remedy. If the pictures are not available. then the vehicle is not at our dealership yet, please call in advance for vehicle availabilityse habla español","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",143.95,"Accident reported: minor to moderate damage"

The engine produces gobs of power, and the Denali's 6.6-second sprint to 60 mph is among the segment's quickest. The 10-speed automatic transmission, though smooth and pleasant enough in everyday driving, takes a few beats to shift into a lower gear when you put your foot down. We also noticed that the transmission treats pushes of manual gear selector buttons more like suggestions than commands.The Yukon's substantial weight and top-heavy design sabotage any chance of praiseworthy handling. It's something you have to accept with a vehicle this large. On the upside, the brakes make it easy to stop smoothly, and the light steering effort is perfect for navigating a crowded Costco lot. The Denali isn't as capable off-road as the AT4 trim, but its air suspension and two-speed transfer case will get you out of some tough spots.How does the Yukon drive?

Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them.

The F-150 competes with the Ram, the Chevrolet Silverado and the GMC Sierra 1500, among others, in the full-sized truck category. Ford is clearly pushing its new technology and new ideas with the F-150, offering plenty of options not available anywhere else in this class, such as a 360-degree camera and integrated loading ramps stowed in the pickup bed. A smaller, more fuel efficient EcoBoost engine is also available, which should further improve fuel economy while providing the same kind of horsepower that would normally be delivered by mid-grade V8 engines. At the same time, the F-150 continues to excel at traditional truck tasks, with a best in class towing capacity of 12,200 pounds when properly equipped. Interesting features of this model are rugged durability, efficient turbocharged engines, improved gas mileage, Towing capacity, and available in a huge variety of trims<br /><br />","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",60.5,"Accident reported: minor to moderate damage"

This allows for a much more sophisticated driving experience, with a stiffer chassis, a better ride and much better handling, making it far more refined and makes fewer compromises than just about any truck on the market. The Honda Ridgeline competes with other compact pickup trucks such as the Toyota Tacoma. * Roomy interior, car-like driving experience, compact exterior dimensions, innovative truck bed with tons of storage options, available all-wheel drive.

Maybe you fell asleep. Maybe you lost consciousness. No matter how it happens, Unresponsive driver assistant works to help lessen the danger when it does. It detects prolonged driver unresponsiveness, automatically bringing the vehicle to a stop and turning on the hazard lights. If equipped, emergency services will also be contacted. Unresponsive driver assistant is safety that never sleeps.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane. Meet your ultimate co-pilot with hands-on cruise control.</li><li> Forward collision mitigation - Forward thinking. You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them.

One of those is “relationship.” With every introduction, we are looking, not for a single transaction, but to “develop” a relationship with our customers...not just a good relationship, but an “outstanding” relationship that will outlast your car. Another key element is that “everybody wins”. In a time when most people believe winners create losers, we endeavor to satisfy everybody involved. It means knowing our product well and our customer even better. It means listening and caring and understanding that people buy their second-most expensive item from people they trust. Whether you are a car enthusiast, or you just need a reliable ride, the right car for you means buying exactly what you need and ideally what you want. Over forty years ago, we entered the automobile business driven by a passion for people, and recognizing cars as a “vehicle” for creating meaningful connections. We also understood that helping people select, purchase and finance one of the most important tools of your daily life is a valuable pursuit. Our priority is and has always been making sure your new or used-car buying experience is both satisfying and successful. Within the Cardinale Automotive Group, we know that satisfying a wide range of needs requires a diversity of quality cars. We offer new Audi, BMW, GMC, Harley Davidson, Hyundai, Mazda, Nissan, Toyota and Volkswagen cars, along with used cars, trucks and SUVs by top manufacturers. We are committed to helping you find the right car, assisting you in choosing the right financing options, and becoming your trusted automobile dealer. Our relationship begins with our introduction and continues through the purchase, the financing, the service of the car and beyond. We look forward to developing an outstanding relationship with you.<br />CARFAX One-Owner.

Finished in classy Beluga paint and hand-built in England, this Flying Spur Speed produces 542 horsepower and 568 lb-ft of torque from its 4.0L twin-turbo V8 engine, paired to an 8-speed automatic transmission and Bentley&#39;s advanced all-wheel-drive system. The result is a 0-60 mph time of just 4.0 seconds and a top speed of 177 mph. It rides on an adaptive air suspension that&#39;s remarkably supple given its 5,200-pound curb weight, offering passengers a supremely comfortable and composed experience. Visually, the Flying Spur displays its performance intent with subtle aggression. Aerodynamic enhancements, darker accent finishes, and bespoke badging distinguish it from its brethren. A bold Diamond matrix grille, exclusive 22-inch wheels, and an illuminated Flying B radiator mascot project elegance in every detail. Craftsmanship and high-quality materials take priority in the Flying Spur&#39;s cabin, with the added benefits of advanced tech for the driver&#39;s convenience. Inside standouts are Beluga leather seats with diamond quilting, a panoramic glass sunroof, and leather-covered door panels with a unique 3-D diamond design. Rear passengers enjoy luxury touches such as power-adjustable climate controlled seats as well as a Bang &amp; Olufsen sound system. The 2023 Bentley Flying Spur S is one of the most refined luxury sedans on the market, distinguished not only by its exclusivity but by its balance of unrivaled performance, cutting-edge technology, and handcrafted British luxury.<br /><br />OPTIONAL EQUIPMENT<br />Beluga<br />Beluga Leather<br />Piano Black Veneer $2,255<br />22&#34; 10-Spoke Speed Wheels $3,695<br />Touring Specification $8,815<br />Bang &amp; Olufsen Sound System $7,355<br />Diamond Quilting Specification $5,600<br />Gloss Black Flying B Mascot $5,060<br />Blackline Specification $4,930<br />Panoramic Glass Sunroof $3,470<br />Contrast Stitching $2,680<br />Mood Lighting Specification $2,645<br />Red Brake Calipers $1,740<br />Rear Seat Head Cushions $1,720<br />Embroidered Bentley Emblems $895<br />Self-Leveling Wheel Badges $615<br /><br />GENERAL<br />Year: 2023<br />Mileage: 20,007<br />VIN #: SCBBG6ZG4PC007634<br />Engine Size: 4.0L V8 (Twin-Turbo)<br />Class: Sedan<br />Horsepower: 542<br />Color: Beluga <br />Interior: Beluga Leather<br />Fuel: Premium Unleaded Gasoline<br />Gear Box: 8-Speed Automatic<br />Doors: 4<br />Seats: 4&#43;1<br />Cylinders: 8<br /><br />SAFETY EQUIPMENT<br />Outboard Front Lap And Shoulder Safety Belts <br />Power Rear Child Safety Locks<br />Airbag Occupancy Sensor<br />Curtain 1st And 2nd Row Airbags<br />Dual Stage Driver And Passenger Front Airbags<br />Tire Specific Low Tire Pressure Warning<br />Reverse Traffic Warning<br />Blind Spot Monitoring<br />Park Assist Automated Parking Sensors<br />Side Impact Beams<br />360 View Backup Camera<br />Adaptive Cruise Control<br /><br />ADDITIONAL INFORMATION<br />1 Key Included<br />Balance of Factory Warranty (if applicable)<br />Extended Warranties Available","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",135.5,

One Low Price is our no-hassle, no-negotiation, no-pressure purchasing experience.

One Low Price takes the risk out of paying too much for your next car. We believe everyone should pay the same fair price for a vehicle, regardless of ability to negotiate. We rigorously research both local and national markets to ensure that every vehicle is priced fairly. Then we go a step further and place that One Low Price on the windshield of every vehicle. This provides our customers with a fair, up-front, and transparent purchasing experience. WHAT'S INCLUDED * One Low Price clearly listed on every vehicle * All rebates and incentives included up front * Priced determined by rigorously researching both local and national markets and trusted third-party sources * Every customer pays the same One Low Price.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",61.7,

Check out the following:\n\nNo Accidents! One Owner! \n \n\nBLACK/BORDEAUX BROWN, NAPPA LEATHER SEATING SURFACES\n\n\n\nThis G90 has the following features:\nConvenience<ul><li> Remote parking - Fit in anywhere! Remote parking system allows you to pull into or out of a space without having to be in the vehicle, simply use the remote control! It&#39;s perfect when the cars next to you are too close for you to be able open your doors. With remote parking, any spot is an open spot!</li><li> GPS linked cruise control - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Meet your ultimate co-pilot, GPS linked cruise control.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control with lane change - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control with lane change, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up, and helps you make lane changes. Meet your ultimate co-pilot, hands-on cruise control with lane change.</li></ul>Technology and Telematics<ul><li> Wireless Apple CarPlay &amp; Android Auto smart device wireless mirroring</li></ul>\n\nEngine: 3.5L Twin-Turbo e-SC GDI MPI DOHC D-CVVT V6 -inc: Idle Stop and Go (ISG), Full-Time All-Wheel, Wheels: 21\&#39; x 8.5J Fr &amp; 21\&#39; x 9.5J Rr Alloy -inc: Diamond cut machined finish, Express Open/Close Sliding And Tilting Glass 1st And 2nd Row Sunroof w/Power Sunshade, Perimeter/Approach Lights, 23 Speakers, 2 LCD Monitors In The Front, Turn-By-Turn Navigation Directions, 10-Way Passenger Seat -inc: Power 4-Way Lumbar Support, Heated Leather/Metal-Look Steering Wheel w/Auto Tilt-Away, Smart Cruise Control w/Stop &amp; Go, Head-Up Display, Cruise Control-Steering Assist, Blind-spot Collision-Avoidance Assist (BCA) Blind Spot, Forward Collision-Avoidance Assist (FCA) w/Junction Turning, Aerial View Camera System, Collision Mitigation-Front, Driver Monitoring-Alert, Evasion Assist, Parking-Automatic-Remote System\n We price our cars, not our Customers.

Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control with lane change - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control with lane change, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up, and helps you make lane changes.

You look away for just a second and suddenly the vehicle in front of you has stopped. That&#39;s when the forward collision mitigation system comes to life. When it senses an impending impact, it will activate a combination of features to help prevent or reduce the severity of an accident. Forward collision mitigation is always looking ahead.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-off cruise control - Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now with hands-off cruise control simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles with minimal steering input from you. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane.

Road trips used to be stressful, until GPS linked cruise control set the pace. Simply set the desired speed and the system uses GPS navigation data to maintain that speed without driver intervention - including slowing down for curves and anticipating hills. This can help minimize driver fatigue and improve overall fuel economy. Meet your ultimate co-pilot, GPS linked cruise control.</li></ul>Safety and Security<ul><li> Lane departure prevention - Keep it between the lines. It only takes a moment of inattention for your vehicle to drift. With lane departure prevention, your vehicle takes corrective action to help you avoid unintentionally moving out of your lane. Lane departure prevention is an extra level of safety for you and those around you.</li><li> Pedestrian impact prevention - An extra step toward safety. Pedestrians don&#39;t always stop, look, and listen, but with Pedestrian Impact Prevention, your vehicle is equipped to better see them and avoid them. This system constantly monitors the road ahead to identify and track pedestrians. It projects that image to an interior display screen, AND should an impact become likely, Pedestrian impact prevention takes steps to avoid a collision.</li><li> Hands-on cruise control. Set it and forget it. Road trips used to be stressful. Cruise control only managed speed, but not distance or safety. Now, with hands-on cruise control, simply set your desired speed and let sensor technology maintain a safe distance between you and surrounding vehicles. It slows you down, speeds you up and even keeps you in your own lane.

The powertrain was rated at 819 horsepower and 885 lb-ft of torque when new, and EPA-estimated range with 21″ wheels was rated at 469 miles.Equipped with heating, ventilation, and massage functions, the 20-way power-adjustable front seats are trimmed in Lucid Black and Graphite leather, while Carbon Oak trim and microsuede upholstery accent the Mojave-scheme interior. Appointments include four-zone climate control, wireless charging, a 21-speaker Surreal Sound audio system, and Lucid UX infotainment.The heated leather-wrapped multifunction steering wheel fronts a 34″ Glass Cockpit display with 5k resolution. The car was built with DreamDrive hardware for semi-autonomous driving capability, and the driver is aided by LIDAR adaptive cruise control, a surround-view camera system, blind-spot monitoring, Automatic Park In & Out, Park Distance Warning, and a driver monitoring system with distracted / drowsy alerts.","[PREMIUM]","[PREMIUM]",187.2,
